### **What is a Database?**
A **database** is an organized collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.

Think of it like a **digital filing cabinet** where data is stored in a structured way so software applications can use it efficiently.

---

### **🔍** 

### **Why is a Database Needed?**

1. **Data Storage**: To store large amounts of data (e.g., users, orders, payments).
    
2. **Data Retrieval**: To quickly find and retrieve specific data (e.g., show your Amazon order history).
    
3. **Data Consistency**: To keep data accurate and in sync across systems.
    
4. **Security**: To control who can access or change the data.
    
5. **Multi-user Access**: Allows many users/apps to work with the same data safely.

### **Types of Databases Used in the Industry**

  

Databases fall into different types based on **how they structure and store data**.

  

#### **1.** **Relational Databases (RDBMS)**

####  **– Most Common**

- **Data Structure**: Tables (rows & columns)
    
- **Examples**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server
    
- **Best For**: Banking, e-commerce, ERP systems
    

  

➡️ Uses **SQL** (Structured Query Language) to query data.

  

#### **2.** **NoSQL Databases**

####  **– For Unstructured/Big Data**

- **Data Structure**: Varies (document, key-value, graph, column)
    
- **Examples**:
    
    - **Document**: MongoDB (stores JSON-like docs)
        
    - **Key-Value**: Redis, DynamoDB
        
    - **Wide Column**: Cassandra
        
    - **Graph**: Neo4j
        
    
- **Best For**: Real-time analytics, social networks, IoT apps, flexible schemas
    

  

➡️ No fixed schema, ideal for scalability and speed.

  

#### **3.** **In-Memory Databases**

- **Data Structure**: Key-value, stored in RAM
    
- **Examples**: Redis, Memcached
    
- **Best For**: Caching, session storage, low-latency apps
    

  

#### **4.** **Time-Series Databases (TSDB)**

- **Data Structure**: Timestamped entries
    
- **Examples**: InfluxDB, TimescaleDB
    
- **Best For**: IoT sensors, stock data, monitoring metrics
    

  

#### **5.** **NewSQL Databases**

- **Data Structure**: Like RDBMS, but with horizontal scalability
    
- **Examples**: CockroachDB, Google Spanner
    
- **Best For**: High-scale apps with consistency needs
    

  

#### **6.** **Object-Oriented Databases**

- Store data as **objects** like in OOP.
    
- Not widely used in mainstream web dev.

Absolutely! Let’s dive into the **🧱 Basics of SQL** with real-life analogies and visuals (where needed) so it’s unforgettable.

---

## **🧠 1.** 

## **What is SQL?**

  

**SQL** stands for **Structured Query Language**.

  

Think of it like the language you use to **talk to a database** — to ask questions, store information, or change things.

---

### **📦 Analogy: Imagine a Library**

- **Database** = The whole library
    
- **Tables** = Bookshelves (each with different types of books)
    
- **Rows** = Each book on a shelf
    
- **Columns** = Book details like Title, Author, Genre
    

  

🔤 **SQL is the language you use to ask the librarian for information**:

- “Give me all books written by J.K. Rowling.” → SELECT
    
- “Add this new book to the Fantasy shelf.” → INSERT
    
- “Remove this old book.” → DELETE
    
- “Make a new shelf for Science books.” → CREATE TABLE
    

---

## **🧩 2.** 

## **Types of SQL Commands**

  

SQL is divided into 5 categories based on what the command does:

|**Category**|**Stands For**|**Purpose**|
|---|---|---|
|**DDL**|Data Definition Language|Define or modify database structure (tables, schemas)|
|**DML**|Data Manipulation Language|Modify the actual data (add/update/delete rows)|
|**DQL**|Data Query Language|Retrieve data (reading only)|
|**DCL**|Data Control Language|Permissions and access control|
|**TCL**|Transaction Control Language|Managing multiple operations together (commit/rollback)|

Let’s break these down:

---

### **🧱 2.1.** 

### **DDL – Data Definition Language**

  

📌 **Purpose**: To create, modify, or delete the _structure_ of tables.

|**Command**|**What it does**|
|---|---|
|CREATE|Create a new table or database|
|ALTER|Change an existing table’s structure|
|DROP|Delete a table or database permanently|

🧠 Example:

```
CREATE TABLE students (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  age INT
);
```

  

---

### **🛠 2.2.** 

### **DML – Data Manipulation Language**

  

📌 **Purpose**: To **insert**, **update**, or **delete** rows in a table.

|**Command**|**What it does**|
|---|---|
|INSERT|Add new rows|
|UPDATE|Modify existing rows|
|DELETE|Remove rows|

🧠 Example:

```
INSERT INTO students (id, name, age)
VALUES (1, 'Akshita', 22);
```

  

---

### **🔍 2.3.** 

### **DQL – Data Query Language**

  

📌 **Purpose**: To fetch data from the database.

|**Command**|**What it does**|
|---|---|
|SELECT|Retrieve data (read)|

🧠 Example:

```
SELECT name FROM students WHERE age > 20;
```

  

---

### **🔐 2.4.** 

### **DCL – Data Control Language**

  

📌 **Purpose**: Manage **who can access** what.

|**Command**|**What it does**|
|---|---|
|GRANT|Give permission to a user|
|REVOKE|Take back permissions|

🧠 Example:

```
GRANT SELECT ON students TO user1;
```

  

---

### **🔄 2.5.** 

### **TCL – Transaction Control Language**

  

📌 **Purpose**: Manage groups of operations (especially in banking, e-commerce).

|**Command**|**What it does**|
|---|---|
|COMMIT|Save changes permanently|
|ROLLBACK|Undo changes|
|SAVEPOINT|Save a point you can roll back to|

🧠 Example:

```
BEGIN;

UPDATE students SET age = 23 WHERE id = 1;

ROLLBACK; -- Will undo the above change
```

  

---

## **✅ 3. How to Create Tables & Insert Data**

  

### **🏗 Create Table (DDL)**

```
CREATE TABLE employees (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  department VARCHAR(50),
  salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
  hire_date DATE
);
```

### **➕ Insert Data (DML)**

```
INSERT INTO employees (id, name, department, salary, hire_date)
VALUES (1, 'Akshita', 'Engineering', 85000.00, '2024-01-10');
```

  

---

## **🎓 Cheat Code to Remember Categories**

  

**📖 DDL**: Defines the shape (Create, Alter, Drop)

**✍️ DML**: Edits the data (Insert, Update, Delete)

**🔍 DQL**: Looks at data (Select)

**🔐 DCL**: Controls access (Grant, Revoke)

**🎮 TCL**: Manages transactions (Commit, Rollback)

## **✅ 2.** 

## **Core SQL Concepts**

---

### **🔹 A.** 

### **SELECT**

###  **Statements – Your Primary Tool**

  

#### **📌 Purpose:**

  

Used to **retrieve data** from a table.

  

#### **🧠 Basic Syntax:**

```
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;
```

#### **🎯 Example:**

```
SELECT name, age FROM students;
```

🧠 Think of this like saying:

  

> “Show me the name and age of every student in the students table.”

---

### **🔹 B.** 

### **WHERE**

###  **Clause – Filter the Results**

  

#### **📌 Purpose:**

  

Used to **filter** records based on a condition.

  

#### **🧠 Syntax:**

```
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age > 20;
```

🎯 Meaning:

  

> “Give me all students whose age is greater than 20.”

  

You can use operators like:

- =, !=, <, >, <=, >=
    
- Logical: AND, OR, NOT
    

  

#### **💡 Example:**

```
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE department = 'HR' AND salary > 50000;
```

  

---

### **🔹 C.** 

### **ORDER BY**

###  **– Sort the Results**

  

#### **📌 Purpose:**

  

Used to **sort** the result set by one or more columns.

  

#### **🧠 Syntax:**

```
SELECT * FROM students ORDER BY age ASC;  -- ascending
SELECT * FROM students ORDER BY age DESC; -- descending
```

🎯 Meaning:

  

> “List students sorted by their age in ascending or descending order.”

---

### **🔹 D.** 

### **LIMIT**

###  **– Cut It Short**

  

#### **📌 Purpose:**

  

Used to **restrict the number of rows** returned.

  

#### **🧠 Syntax:**

```
SELECT * FROM students ORDER BY age DESC LIMIT 5;
```

🎯 Meaning:

  

> “Show me the top 5 oldest students.”

  

📌 In some databases (like Oracle), LIMIT is replaced with FETCH FIRST or ROWNUM.

---

### **🔹 E.** 

### **DISTINCT**

###  **– No Duplicates Allowed**

  

#### **📌 Purpose:**

  

Used to **remove duplicates** from the result.

  

#### **🧠 Syntax:**

```
SELECT DISTINCT department FROM employees;
```

🎯 Meaning:

  

> “Give me a list of all unique departments (no duplicates).”

---

### **🔹 F.** 

### **BETWEEN**

###  **– Range Filtering**

  

#### **📌 Purpose:**

  

Filter values within a **range**.

  

#### **🧠 Syntax:**

```
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE age BETWEEN 18 AND 25;
```

🎯 Meaning:

  

> “Give me all students aged between 18 and 25 (inclusive).”

---

### **🔹 G.** 

### **IN**

###  **– Match Against a List**

  

#### **📌 Purpose:**

  

Used when matching **multiple values**.

  

#### **🧠 Syntax:**

```
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE department IN ('HR', 'Sales', 'Tech');
```

🎯 Meaning:

  

> “Show employees from HR, Sales, or Tech.”

---

### **🔹 H.** 

### **LIKE**

###  **– Pattern Matching**

  

#### **📌 Purpose:**

  

Used for **wildcard-based matching** in strings.

  

#### **🧠 Syntax:**

```
SELECT * FROM students WHERE name LIKE 'A%';
```

🎯 Meaning:

  

> “Find students whose name starts with ‘A’.”

|**Pattern**|**Meaning**|
|---|---|
|'A%'|Starts with A|
|'%a'|Ends with a|
|'%an%'|Contains ‘an’ anywhere|
|'____'|Exactly 4 characters|
|'A___'|Starts with A and has 4 chars|
