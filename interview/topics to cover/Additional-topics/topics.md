### 1. **Data Structures**

- **Arrays/Strings**: Understanding how to manipulate arrays, sliding window, two-pointer technique.
- **Linked Lists**: Operations like reversal, finding the middle, detecting loops.
- **Stacks & Queues**: Use cases like expression evaluation, implementing a queue using two stacks, etc.
- **Hash Tables**: Common problems like finding duplicates, counting elements, etc.
- **Trees & Graphs**: Binary trees, binary search trees, tree traversal (preorder, inorder, postorder), graph traversal (BFS, DFS).
- **Heaps/Priority Queues**: Understanding min-heap, max-heap, heap sort, and using heaps in problems like merging k sorted lists.

### 2. **Algorithms**

- **Sorting and Searching**: Binary search, quicksort, mergesort, and understanding their time complexities.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Problem-solving with recursion and memoization (e.g., Fibonacci, longest common subsequence).
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Understanding problems where you can take the local optimum to find the global optimum.
- **Backtracking**: Problems like Sudoku, N-Queens, or generating permutations.
- **Divide and Conquer**: Merge sort, quick sort, and other problems that can be broken into smaller subproblems.

### 3. **Time and Space Complexity**

- **Big O Notation**: Be able to analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms (O(n), O(log n), O(n^2), etc.)
- **Space Optimizations**: Techniques like in-place algorithms to save space.

### 4. **System Design (for senior-level positions)**

- **Design Patterns**: Singleton, Factory, Observer, etc.
- **Scalability and Load Balancing**: Horizontal vs vertical scaling, CAP theorem, designing for large-scale systems.
- **Databases**: SQL vs NoSQL, normalization, and indexing.
- **Caching**: Concepts like Redis or Memcached and how they can improve system performance.

### 5. **Coding Practices**

- **Problem Solving**: Focus on writing clean, maintainable code. Pay attention to edge cases.
- **Testing**: Understand the importance of unit testing, edge cases, and how to debug.

### 6. **Behavioral Questions**

- Don’t forget to prepare for behavioral questions such as:
    - Tell me about a time you faced a challenging bug.
    - How do you prioritize tasks in a project?
    - Have you worked in a team? How do you handle conflicts?

### **System Design Basics (Java Context)**

- How would you design a URL shortener, chat app, payment system, etc.
    
- Scalability principles (horizontal vs vertical scaling)
    
- Load balancers, service registries, caches
    
- CAP theorem (Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance)
    
- Design for fault tolerance and high availability
   



### **Caching**

- Why caching? Where to cache?
    
- Types: In-memory (Map, Guava), distributed (Redis, Hazelcast)
    
- Cache invalidation strategies
    
- TTL (Time to live), LFU, LRU
    
- @Cacheable, @CacheEvict in Spring
