- Why/when to migrate to Microservices
    
- Size and boundaries of a microservice (DDD basics)

ðŸ§  _Q_: How would you refactor a monolithic app to microservices?

---

### **ðŸ”¹ 2.**Â 

### **API Gateway Pattern**

- Role of an API Gateway (routing, security, rate limiting, aggregation)
    
- Spring Cloud Gateway vs Netflix Zuul vs Kong vs NGINX
    
- Cross-cutting concerns at the gateway:
    
    - Authentication/Authorization
        
    - Logging
        
    - Retry and fallback
        
    
- Path rewrite, circuit breaking, rate limiting in Gateway
    
- Custom filters in Spring Cloud Gateway
    

  

ðŸ§  _Q_: Why is API Gateway preferred over direct service-to-service calls?

---

### **ðŸ”¹ 3.**Â 

### **Service Discovery**

- Why service discovery? Dynamic registration & lookup
    
- Netflix Eureka:
    
    - @EnableEurekaServer, @EnableEurekaClient
        
    - How services register and discover
        
    - Heartbeats and renewal
        
    
- Consul/Zookeeper alternative
    
- DNS-based discovery in Kubernetes
    

  

ðŸ§  _Q_: What happens when a service crashes in Eureka? How is failure detected?

---

### **ðŸ”¹ 4.**Â 

### **Circuit Breakers & Resilience**

- What is a circuit breaker? Why is it needed?
    
- Resilience4j vs Hystrix (Hystrix is deprecated)
    
- Resilience4j modules:
    
    - CircuitBreaker
        
    - Retry
        
    - RateLimiter
        
    - Bulkhead
        
    - TimeLimiter
        
    
- Spring Boot integration with annotations: @CircuitBreaker, @Retry, @RateLimiter
    
- Fallback methods
    

  

ðŸ§  _Q_: Whatâ€™s the difference between Retry and Circuit Breaker?

---

### **ðŸ”¹ 5.**Â 

### **Spring Cloud Config**

- Centralized configuration for all microservices
    
- Git-backed configuration files (per service/environment)
    
- spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri
    
- Dynamic refresh with @RefreshScope and /actuator/refresh
    
- Config encryption (symmetric/asymmetric keys)
    
- Fallback to local config
    

  

ðŸ§  _Q_: What if config server is down? How do you ensure resilience?

---

### **ðŸ”¹ 6.**Â 

### **Client-Side Load Balancing**

- Netflix Ribbon (deprecated)
    
- Spring Cloud LoadBalancer (new default)
    
- How it integrates with service discovery
    
- Round-robin and random strategies
    
- Load balancing in Feign clients
    

  

ðŸ§  _Q_: Difference between Ribbon and Spring Cloud LoadBalancer?

---

### **ðŸ”¹ 7.**Â 

### **Inter-service Communication**

  

#### **ðŸŸ¢ REST (Synchronous)**

- REST template (deprecated)
    
- WebClient (non-blocking)
    
- Feign client with @FeignClient, fallback with Hystrix/Resilience4j
    

  

#### **ðŸŸ  Asynchronous**

- Kafka, RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ
    
- Pub-Sub vs Point-to-Point
    
- Event-driven communication
    

  

#### **ðŸŸ£ gRPC (Optional)**

- Binary, contract-first protocol
    
- Better for internal comms requiring performance
    

  

ðŸ§  _Q_: When would you prefer Kafka over Feign?

---

### **ðŸ”¹ 8.**Â 

### **Distributed Challenges**

- **Tracing**:
    
    - Spring Cloud Sleuth + Zipkin
        
    - OpenTelemetry / Jaeger
        
    
- **Logging**:
    
    - Centralized logging: ELK (ElasticSearch, Logstash, Kibana)
        
    
- **Debugging**:
    
    - Correlation IDs, MDC, log tracing
        
    
- **Distributed transactions**:
    
    - 2PC (not preferred), Saga Pattern
        
    
- **Consistency**:
    
    - Eventual consistency
        
    - Idempotency
        
    

  

ðŸ§  _Q_: How do you trace a request across services?

---

### **ðŸ”¹ 9.**Â 

### **Service Deployment & CI/CD**

- Dockerizing services (Dockerfile, Docker Compose)
    
- CI pipelines for multiple services (Jenkins, GitHub Actions)
    
- Kubernetes basics (pods, services, deployments)
    
- Service Mesh overview: Istio, Linkerd (optional)
    

---

### **ðŸ”¹ 10.**Â 

### **Security in Microservices**

- OAuth2 / OpenID Connect across microservices
    
- Centralized authentication (Keycloak/Okta/Auth0)
    
- JWT token propagation via gateway
    
- Scopes and claims in JWT
    
- Role-based access (hasAuthority(), @PreAuthorize)
    

  

ðŸ§  _Q_: How do you handle token validation across services?

---

### **ðŸ”¹ 11.**Â 

### **Testing Microservices**

- Contract testing with Spring Cloud Contract
