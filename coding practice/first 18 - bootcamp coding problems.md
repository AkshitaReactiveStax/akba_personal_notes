==Problem 1: Find Maximum in Array==
==Write a Java program to find the maximum value in an array of integers.==

==problem 2 : Palindrome Check==
==Objective==
==Write a Java program to check if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and case differences.==

==Steps to Implement Palindrome Check==
==Input the string: Take a string as input from the user.==
==Normalize the string: Remove non-alphanumeric characters and convert it to lower case.==
==Check for palindrome:==
==Compare characters from the beginning and end of the string moving towards the center.==
==If all corresponding characters match, the string is a palindrome.==
==Output the result: Print whether the string is a palindrome or not.==


==problem 3 : Create a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).==

==Requirements:==
==Use classes to model the calculator.==
==Use control flow statements to handle invalid operations (e.g., division by zero).==

==problem 4 : Print first 50 odd numbers==

==problem 5 : Print first 50 even numbers==

==problem 6 : Add the first 50 even numbers and print the sum==

==problem 7 : Add the first 50 odd numbers and print the sum==


==problem 8 : Calculate the factorial of number n (1 >> n <= 12)==
==for the factorial problem …==

==Here’s a very simple explanation of how to calculate the factorial of a number:==

==Start with the number you want to find the factorial of. Let's say it's 5.==
==Multiply that number by every whole number less than it, one at a time, until you get to 1.==
==So for 5, you would do:==

==5 times 4 is 20.==
==20 times 3 is 60.==
==60 times 2 is 120.==
==120 times 1 is 120.==
==So, the factorial of 5 is 120.==

==In short, to find the factorial of a number:==

==Start with the number.==
==Keep multiplying it by each smaller number down to 1.==
==The final result is the factorial.==
==The factorial of 5 (written as 5!) is 120.==


==problem 9 : Print the first n number in the fibonacci series ( 1 >> n << 100)==
==For Fibonacci series.== 

==Here’s a simple explanation of how to generate the Fibonacci series for a number:==

==Start with the first two numbers of the series, which are 0 and 1.==
==To get the next number in the series, add the two previous numbers together.==
==Keep adding the last two numbers to get the next number, and continue this process.==
==Let's generate the first 8 numbers in the Fibonacci series as an example:==

==Start with 0 and 1.==
==0 + 1 = 1 (So the series is now: 0, 1, 1)==
==1 + 1 = 2 (So the series is now: 0, 1, 1, 2)==
==1 + 2 = 3 (So the series is now: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3)==
==2 + 3 = 5 (So the series is now: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5)==
==3 + 5 = 8 (So the series is now: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8)==
==5 + 8 = 13 (So the series is now: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13)==
==And you can keep going as long as you want.==

==In summary, to generate the Fibonacci series:==

==Start with 0 and 1.==
==Add the last two numbers to get the next number in the series.==
==Repeat the process to get as many numbers in the series as you need.==
