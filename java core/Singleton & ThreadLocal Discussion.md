```
public final class ClassSingleton {
	private static ClassSingleton INSTANCE;
    private String info = "Initial info class";
    private ClassSingleton() {        
    }
    
    public static ClassSingleton getInstance() {
        if(INSTANCE == null) {
            INSTANCE = new ClassSingleton();
        }
        return INSTANCE;
    }
    // getters and setters

}
```

While this is a common approach, it’s important to note that it can be problematic in multithreading scenarios, which is the main reason for using Singletons.


Simply put, it can result in more than one instance, breaking the pattern’s core principle. Although there are locking solutions to this problem, our next approach solves these problems at a root level.
why explain ? and can using threadLocal be a solution for it ? if yes, how?

Answer::
You’re correct that the implementation you’ve posted can create multiple instances if accessed concurrently by multiple threads. The reason is that if two threads enter the getInstance method simultaneously and find INSTANCE to be null, they may both proceed to create a new instance, resulting in two separate objects. This defeats the purpose of the Singleton pattern, which is meant to ensure a single, shared instance throughout the application.

  

**Solutions to Ensure Singleton in Multithreaded Scenarios**

  

1. **Double-Checked Locking (DCL)**: One way to handle this is by adding synchronized locking with a “double-checked locking” pattern:
```
public static ClassSingleton getInstance() {
    if (INSTANCE == null) {
        synchronized (ClassSingleton.class) {
            if (INSTANCE == null) {
                INSTANCE = new ClassSingleton();
            }
        }
    }
    return INSTANCE;
    }
```

This approach reduces the cost of synchronization, only locking the initialization code when the instance is created for the first time.

2. **Using an** enum: A more modern approach in Java is to use an enum to create a Singleton. This approach provides a guaranteed single instance with lazy initialization and is thread-safe by design.
```
public enum ClassSingleton {
    INSTANCE;
    private String info = "Initial info class";
    
    public String getInfo() {
        return info;
    }
    
    public void setInfo(String info) {
        this.info = info;
    }
}
```

3. **Bill Pugh Singleton Design**: This approach relies on a static inner helper class that holds the Singleton instance. This is thread-safe and avoids the need for synchronized locking.
```
public class ClassSingleton {
    private String info = "Initial info class";

    private ClassSingleton() {}
    
    private static class SingletonHelper {
        private static final ClassSingleton INSTANCE = new ClassSingleton();
    }
    
    public static ClassSingleton getInstance() {
        return SingletonHelper.INSTANCE;
    }
}
```

**Can ThreadLocal Be Used for a Singleton?**

  

Using ThreadLocal would technically work, but it’s not ideal for a Singleton pattern since it restricts each thread to its own separate instance of the Singleton class rather than sharing a single instance across threads. With ThreadLocal, each thread calling getInstance() would receive its own version of the Singleton, so this approach would defeat the purpose of a true Singleton, which is to ensure a single shared instance application-wide.

  

Here’s an example with ThreadLocal, but remember, this isn’t a true Singleton
```
private static final ThreadLocal<ClassSingleton> threadLocalInstance = 
    ThreadLocal.withInitial(ClassSingleton::new);

public static ClassSingleton getInstance() {
    return threadLocalInstance.get();
}

```
This might be useful if each thread needs its own instance, but if your goal is a truly shared Singleton, you’d typically use one of the other thread-safe approaches.




## **Common Pitfalls**[](https://www.baeldung.com/java-singleton#pitfalls)

Singleton is a deceptively simple design pattern, and there are few common mistakes that a programmer might commit when creating a singleton.
We can distinguish two types of issues with singletons:

- existential (do we need a singleton?)
- implementational (did we implement it properly?)
  
  
  ### Existential Issues[](https://www.baeldung.com/java-singleton#1-existential-issues)

Conceptually, a singleton is a kind of global variable. In general, we know that global variables should be avoided, especially if their states are mutable.

**We’re not saying that we should never use singletons; however, we are saying that there might be more efficient ways to organize our code.**

If a method’s implementation depends on a singleton object, why not pass it as a parameter? In this case, we explicitly show what the method depends on. As a result, we may easily mock these dependencies (if necessary) when performing testing.

For example, singletons are often used to encompass the application’s configuration data (i.e., connection to the repository). If they’re used as global objects, it becomes difficult to choose the configuration for the test environment.

Therefore, when we run the tests, the production database gets spoiled with the test data, which is hardly acceptable.

If we need a singleton, we might consider the possibility of delegating its instantiation to another class, a sort of factory, that should take care of assuring that there’s just one instance of the singleton in play.


### Implementational Issues[](https://www.baeldung.com/java-singleton#2-implementational-issues)

Even though the singletons seem quite simple, their implementations may suffer from various issues. All result in the fact that we might end up having more than just one instance of the class.

**Synchronization**  
The implementation with a private constructor that we presented above isn’t thread-safe. It works well in a single-threaded environment, but in a multi-threaded one, we should use the synchronization technique to guarantee the atomicity of the operation:

```java
public synchronized static ClassSingleton getInstance() {
    if (INSTANCE == null) {
        INSTANCE = new ClassSingleton();
    }
    return INSTANCE;
}
```

Note the keyword _synchronized_ in the method declaration. The method’s body has several operations (comparison, instantiation, and return).

In absence of synchronization, there’s a possibility that two threads interleave their executions in such a way that the expression _INSTANCE == null_ evaluates to _true_ for both threads, and as a result, two instances of _ClassSingleton_ get created.

_Synchronization_ might significantly affect the performance. If this code gets invoked often, we should speed it up using various techniques like _lazy initialization_ or _double-checked locking_ (be aware that this might not work as expected due to compiler optimizations).  We can see more details in our article “[Double-Checked Locking with Singleton](https://www.baeldung.com/java-singleton-double-checked-locking).”


**Multiple Instances**  
There are several other issues with the singletons related to the JVM itself that could cause us to end up with multiple instances of a singleton. These issues are quite subtle, and we’ll give a brief description for each of them:

1. A singleton is supposed to be unique per JVM. This might be a problem for distributed systems or systems whose internals are based on distributed technologies.
2. Every class loader might load its version of the singleton.
3. A singleton might be garbage-collected once no one holds a reference to it. This issue doesn’t lead to the presence of multiple singleton instances at a time, but when recreated, the instance might differ from its previous version.

```
this is a utility singleton class from my project which is a multi thread program . i want to know what is the purpose of using thread local  here and does it defies the purpose of singleton in any way  and why do we need it in general?

Answer::
The use of ThreadLocal<Session> in your HibernateTransactionUtil is a practical choice for multithreaded applications because it ensures that each thread operates with its own Session instance. Here’s why it’s helpful and why it doesn’t undermine the Singleton design pattern in this context:


**Purpose of ThreadLocal in HibernateTransactionUtil**
In a multithreaded environment, if each thread used a shared Session instance (without ThreadLocal), you’d likely run into issues since Session instances are not thread-safe in Hibernate. They manage the state and lifecycle of entities, so concurrent access could lead to unpredictable results, data integrity issues, or even application crashes.

  

With ThreadLocal, each thread receives a unique Session bound to that thread. This ensures isolation between transactions handled by different threads while still allowing HibernateTransactionUtil to be a Singleton. So, ThreadLocal helps avoid conflicts without violating the Singleton pattern since it doesn’t create multiple instances of HibernateTransactionUtil; it merely provides a separate Session instance per thread.


**Why This Doesn’t Defeat Singleton**
The Singleton pattern ensures a single instance of HibernateTransactionUtil across the application, which is still true here. ThreadLocal<Session> doesn’t create multiple instances of HibernateTransactionUtil; it only provides a unique Session object per thread. The Singleton pattern in this utility class controls shared resources (like the SessionFactory) and configuration settings, while ThreadLocal is used to isolate Session instances where thread safety is critical.

  

**General Need for ThreadLocal in Multithreaded Applications**
ThreadLocal is useful in scenarios where:

• **Thread-specific data**: Each thread requires its own instance of a resource (like a database Session or user-specific information).

• **Avoiding synchronization overhead**: ThreadLocal allows per-thread instances without locking or synchronizing access, leading to better performance and simplified code.

  

In your case, each thread can start, commit, or roll back transactions independently without stepping on another thread’s transaction, which is crucial for transaction safety in a multithreaded database application.
