### All About Strings in Java for Senior Developers

As a senior developer, your understanding of **strings** should not only include the basic operations and methods but also extend to **optimization**, **performance considerations**, and **system-level design** when working with strings in real-world applications.

Here’s a comprehensive breakdown of what a senior developer should know about **strings** in Java:

### 1. **String Basics and Immutable Nature**

- **Immutability**:
  - **Strings in Java are immutable**. Once a `String` object is created, its value cannot be changed. Any modification to a string creates a new `String` object.
  - **Example**:
    ```java
    String str1 = "hello";
    str1 = str1 + " world";  // A new String is created here.
    ```

- **Why Immutability?**
  - String immutability makes strings thread-safe and helps with memory efficiency, especially with string interning.
  - It also allows string reuse through **string pooling**.

- **String Pool**:
  - Strings in Java are stored in a **String Pool** (also called the **intern pool**). When a string is created with a literal (e.g., `"hello"`), it is stored in the pool. If the same string literal is encountered again, it points to the existing string in the pool.

### 2. **String Manipulation and Methods**

- **Common String Methods**:
  - `length()`: Returns the length of the string.
  - `charAt(index)`: Returns the character at the specified index.
  - `substring(int start, int end)`: Extracts a substring from the string.
  - `indexOf(String str)`: Finds the index of the first occurrence of the specified string.
  - `toLowerCase()`, `toUpperCase()`: Converts the string to lowercase or uppercase.
  - `trim()`: Removes leading and trailing spaces.
  - `replace(char oldChar, char newChar)`: Replaces all occurrences of the specified character.
  - `split(String regex)`: Splits the string into an array of strings based on the specified delimiter.

- **StringBuilder vs String**:
  - **StringBuilder** is used when performing **frequent modifications** to a string, as it is **mutable** and **more efficient** compared to using `String` in these cases. StringBuilder can avoid the overhead of creating new string objects repeatedly.

### 3. **Performance Considerations**

- **String Concatenation**:
  - **Inefficient concatenation** using `+` or `+=` in loops leads to multiple intermediate `String` objects. It’s better to use `StringBuilder` or `StringBuffer` for concatenation in loops or repetitive operations.
  - Example (inefficient):
    ```java
    String result = "";
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
        result += i;  // Creates a new String each time.
    }
    ```
  - Example (efficient):
    ```java
    StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
        result.append(i);  // No creation of new String objects.
    }
    ```

- **String Pooling**:
  - When you create a string using a literal, Java uses the **String pool** to store and reuse the object, saving memory. For large-scale applications, this can be crucial.
  - However, **new String()** creates a new string object every time, even if the same string exists in the pool.
    ```java
    String s1 = "hello";
    String s2 = new String("hello");  // s2 will not refer to the same object as s1.
    ```

### 4. **Unicode and Encoding**

- **Character Encoding**:
  - Strings in Java are sequences of **Unicode characters**. Java uses UTF-16 encoding for `String` objects.
  - You should be familiar with handling different encodings, such as **UTF-8** or **ISO-8859-1**, when reading from or writing to files, or interacting with APIs.

- **Character vs String**:
  - A **Character** is a single 16-bit Unicode character, while a **String** is an array of characters. Strings can represent larger characters, including special symbols and emojis.

### 5. **Advanced String Techniques**

- **Regular Expressions (Regex)**:
  - Strings in Java support **regular expressions** for pattern matching.
  - You should be proficient with methods like `matches()`, `replaceAll()`, `split()`, and `Pattern.compile()` for complex string operations.
  - Example:
    ```java
    String regex = "^[A-Za-z0-9]+$";  // Alphanumeric validation
    boolean isValid = "123abc".matches(regex);  // Returns true
    ```

- **Handling Large Strings Efficiently**:
  - When working with large strings (e.g., file processing), consider using **BufferedReader** or **Stream API** to handle data in chunks instead of loading everything into memory at once.

- **Internationalization (i18n)**:
  - Working with strings in multiple languages and different character sets requires knowledge of **Internationalization (i18n)**, especially when formatting, sorting, and displaying strings in various locales.

### 6. **Common Pitfalls**

- **String Comparison**:
  - Use `.equals()` for **content comparison** and `.==` for **reference comparison**.
  - **Example**:
    ```java
    String s1 = "hello";
    String s2 = new String("hello");
    System.out.println(s1 == s2);       // false (different references)
    System.out.println(s1.equals(s2));  // true (same content)
    ```

- **Null Pointer Exceptions**:
  - Be careful when performing operations on potentially `null` strings, especially when concatenating or using methods that assume non-null values.
  - Use `Objects.isNull()` or `StringUtils.isEmpty()` (from Apache Commons Lang) to check for null/empty strings.

### Coding Questions on Strings for Senior Developer Interviews

Here are some coding challenges and questions that can help you demonstrate your deep understanding of strings in interviews:

#### **1. String Compression (Basic String Operations)**

**Problem**: Implement a method to perform basic string compression using counts of repeated characters. For example, `"aabcccccaaa"` becomes `"a2b1c5a3"`. If the compressed string is not shorter than the original string, return the original string.

**Approach**:
- Traverse the string, count consecutive characters, and build the compressed string.
- Compare the length of the compressed string to the original.

**Code**:
```java
public String compressString(String str) {
    if (str == null || str.length() == 0) return str;

    StringBuilder compressed = new StringBuilder();
    int count = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i < str.length(); i++) {
        if (str.charAt(i) == str.charAt(i - 1)) {
            count++;
        } else {
            compressed.append(str.charAt(i - 1)).append(count);
            count = 1;
        }
    }
    compressed.append(str.charAt(str.length() - 1)).append(count);

    return compressed.length() < str.length() ? compressed.toString() : str;
}
```

#### **2. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**

**Problem**: Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

**Approach**:
- Use the **sliding window technique** with two pointers and a hash set or map to track characters.

**Code**:
```java
public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
    Set<Character> set = new HashSet<>();
    int left = 0, maxLength = 0;
    
    for (int right = 0; right < s.length(); right++) {
        while (set.contains(s.charAt(right))) {
            set.remove(s.charAt(left));
            left++;
        }
        set.add(s.charAt(right));
        maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
    }
    return maxLength;
}
```

#### **3. Palindrome Check**

**Problem**: Given a string, check if it is a palindrome. Ignore non-alphanumeric characters and case.

**Approach**:
- Use two pointers, one starting from the beginning and the other from the end, and move toward the center.

**Code**:
```java
public boolean isPalindrome(String s) {
    int left = 0, right = s.length() - 1;
    
    while (left < right) {
        while (left < right && !Character.isLetterOrDigit(s.charAt(left))) {
            left++;
        }
        while (left < right && !Character.isLetterOrDigit(s.charAt(right))) {
            right--;
        }
        
        if (Character.toLowerCase(s.charAt(left)) != Character.toLowerCase(s.charAt(right))) {
            return false;
        }
        left++;
        right--;
    }
    return true;
}
```

#### **4. Anagram Check**

**Problem**: Given two strings, check if they are anagrams of each other.

**Approach**:
- Sort both strings and compare them, or use a frequency count of characters.

**Code**:
```java
public boolean areAnagrams(String s1, String s2) {
    if (s1.length() != s2.length()) return false;
    
    int[] count = new int[256];  // assuming ASCII
    for (int i = 0; i < s1.length(); i++) {
        count[s1.charAt(i)]++;
        count[s2.charAt(i)]--;
    }
    
    for (int c : count) {
        if (c != 0) return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

#### **5. Reverse Words in a String**

**Problem**: Reverse the words in a given string. For example, `"The quick brown fox"` becomes `"fox brown quick The"`.

**Approach**:
- Split the string into words, reverse the word array, and join the words back.

**Code**:
```java
public String reverseWords(String s) {
    String[] words = s.split(" ");
    StringBuilder reversed = new StringBuilder();
    
    for (int i = words.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        reversed.append(words[i]).append(" ");
    }
    return reversed.toString().trim();
}
```

### Additional Reflective Interview Questions on Strings with Answers

#### **1. What is the difference between `StringBuilder` and `StringBuffer`?**

**Answer**: Both `StringBuilder` and `StringBuffer` are used to create mutable strings in Java, meaning their content can be modified without creating new objects each time. However, the key difference lies in thread-safety:
- **`StringBuilder`** is **not synchronized**, making it faster and more efficient when thread-safety is not a concern.
- **`StringBuffer`** is **synchronized**, meaning it is thread-safe but tends to be slower due to the overhead of synchronization.
- For most single-threaded applications or when you are sure that only one thread will modify the string, `StringBuilder` is the preferred choice due to better performance. However, if you need thread-safety, especially in multi-threaded environments, `StringBuffer` should be used.

#### **2. How does string interning work, and what are its benefits?**

**Answer**: String interning is a mechanism in Java where string literals are stored in a common pool, known as the **string pool**, to save memory. When a string is created, if the string already exists in the pool, a reference to the existing string is returned instead of creating a new object. 
- **Benefit**: Interning reduces memory usage by ensuring that identical string literals share the same memory reference. This is particularly useful when working with large sets of strings that are repeated multiple times in the program, improving both memory efficiency and performance.
- **Example**: If you declare two string literals `String s1 = "hello";` and `String s2 = "hello";`, both `s1` and `s2` will point to the same object in the string pool. However, if you use `new String("hello")`, a new string object will be created outside the pool.

#### **3. Explain how `equals()` and `hashCode()` work in relation to strings.**

**Answer**: In Java, the `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods are used for comparing strings and for working with hash-based collections like `HashMap` or `HashSet`. 
- **`equals()`**: This method compares the **content** of two strings. For strings, it checks if the characters in both strings are the same in the same order.
- **`hashCode()`**: The `hashCode()` method returns an integer hash code based on the content of the string. Two strings that are equal according to the `equals()` method must return the same hash code. This is essential for the correct functioning of hash-based collections like `HashMap`.
- **Example**: 
  ```java
  String s1 = "hello";
  String s2 = "hello";
  System.out.println(s1.equals(s2));  // true
  System.out.println(s1.hashCode() == s2.hashCode());  // true
  ```

#### **4. What are the performance implications of using string concatenation (`+`) vs. `StringBuilder`?**

**Answer**: String concatenation using `+` in Java creates a new `String` object for every concatenation, as strings are immutable in Java. This results in the creation of multiple intermediate string objects, leading to increased memory usage and overhead, especially in loops.
- **StringBuilder**, on the other hand, is mutable, and using it avoids the creation of intermediate objects. It appends the new characters to the existing buffer, making it more efficient.
- **Performance Implication**: In cases of repeated concatenation (especially in loops), using `StringBuilder` can drastically improve performance by reducing memory allocation and the number of object creations.
- **Example**:
  - Inefficient: `str += "world";` inside a loop.
  - Efficient: `StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(); sb.append("world");` inside a loop.

#### **5. How do you handle large strings that can't fit into memory?**

**Answer**: When dealing with large strings that exceed available memory, one approach is to process the string in smaller chunks rather than loading the entire string into memory at once.
- **Buffered I/O**: Use `BufferedReader` and `BufferedWriter` to read and write large strings efficiently from files without loading them fully into memory. This allows you to handle large files line-by-line or chunk-by-chunk.
- **Memory-mapped files**: If you're working with very large data (e.g., logs or database exports), you can use `FileChannel` and memory-mapped files to map a file directly into memory and access portions of the file as if they were part of the memory.
- **Streaming API**: In Java 8 and beyond, the `Stream` API can be used to handle large datasets efficiently, allowing you to process the strings or data lazily, reducing memory footprint.

#### **6. Discuss the time complexity of string methods like `substring()`, `indexOf()`, `replace()`, etc.**

**Answer**:
- **`substring()`**: The time complexity of `substring()` is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the substring. In Java 7 and earlier, it creates a new string with the required part of the original string, but with Java 8+, it uses a `String` backing array (the substring is backed by the original string).
- **`indexOf()`**: The time complexity of `indexOf()` is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string. This is because it requires a linear scan through the string to find the first occurrence of the substring.
- **`replace()`**: The time complexity of `replace()` is also **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string. It performs a scan through the string and replaces all occurrences of the target substring with the replacement string.
- **General Rule**: Most string operations in Java that involve searching or transforming the entire string (like `substring()`, `replace()`, `indexOf()`) have a time complexity of **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string.

#### **7. What is Unicode normalization, and how would you handle it?**

**Answer**: Unicode normalization is the process of ensuring that a string is represented in a consistent format. Different characters can be represented in multiple ways in Unicode, but they can be semantically equivalent (e.g., an accented character can be represented as a single code point or a combination of a base character and an accent).
- **Normalization forms**: There are four normalization forms in Unicode: NFD (Canonical Decomposition), NFC (Canonical Decomposition followed by Composition), NFKD (Compatibility Decomposition), and NFKC (Compatibility Decomposition followed by Composition).
- **Handling normalization**: You would typically use Java’s `Normalizer` class (in the `java.text` package) to normalize strings for consistent processing or comparison.
  ```java
  import java.text.Normalizer;
  String normalized = Normalizer.normalize("é", Normalizer.Form.NFC);
  ```

#### **8. Explain how regular expressions work with strings. What is a use case where regex might be better than traditional string methods?**

**Answer**: A **regular expression** (regex) is a powerful tool for pattern matching and manipulating strings. It allows you to search, match, and replace substrings in a flexible way using a pattern that can represent multiple possible strings.
- **Regex Syntax**: Regular expressions use special characters like `.` (any character), `*` (zero or more occurrences), `+` (one or more occurrences), `^` (beginning of a string), and `$` (end of a string), among others.
- **Use Case for Regex**: Regex is particularly useful for complex string searching, such as extracting emails, phone numbers, or validating input formats (e.g., credit card numbers or passwords). It is much more powerful than using traditional string methods like `substring()` or `indexOf()` for pattern matching.
  ```java
  String email = "user@example.com";
  String regex = "^[a-zA-Z0-9_+&*-]+(?:\\.[a-zA-Z0-9_+&*-]+)*@(?:[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,7}$";
  boolean isValid = email.matches(regex);  // Returns true if the email is valid
  ```

#### **9. How would you reverse a string in Java?**

**Answer**: Reversing a string in Java can be done using multiple approaches:
1. **Using StringBuilder**: 
   - The simplest and most efficient way to reverse a string is by using `StringBuilder`. The `reverse()` method of `StringBuilder` can reverse the string in **O(n)** time complexity, where `n` is the length of the string.
   ```java
   String s = "Hello";
   String reversed = new StringBuilder(s).reverse().toString();
   ```
2. **Using a Loop**:
   - You can reverse a string manually by iterating over the characters and building a new string.
   ```java
   String s = "Hello";
   String reversed = "";
   for (int i = s.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
       reversed += s.charAt(i);
   }
   ```
3. **Using Recursion**:
   - You can reverse a string recursively as follows:
   ```java
   public String reverse(String s) {
       if (s.isEmpty()) {
           return s;
       }
       return reverse(s.substring(1)) + s.charAt(0);
   }
   ```

#### **10. How do you handle string comparison in a case-insensitive manner?**

**Answer**: To compare strings without considering case, you should use the `equalsIgnoreCase()` method, which is specifically designed for case-insensitive comparison.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  String s1 = "Hello";
  String s2 = "hello";
  boolean isEqual = s1.equalsIgnoreCase(s2);  // Returns true
  ```
- Alternatively, you can convert both strings to a common case (either upper or lower) and use the `equals()` method:
  ```java
  boolean isEqual = s1.toLowerCase().equals(s2.toLowerCase());
  ```

These additional questions and answers will not only test your theoretical understanding but also provide insight into practical considerations, edge cases, and performance optimizations when working with strings in Java. These kinds of questions will help interviewers gauge how well you understand the nuances and trade-offs associated with string handling.





#MediumLevelCodingQuestions

Sure! Below are additional **medium-level string questions** that will test your understanding of string manipulation, algorithms, and problem-solving skills in Java:

### 1. **Find the First Non-Repeating Character in a String**

**Problem**: Given a string, find the first non-repeating character. If there is no non-repeating character, return `null`.

**Approach**:
- Traverse the string and count the frequency of each character.
- Traverse the string again and find the first character with a frequency of 1.

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public Character firstUniqChar(String s) {
    HashMap<Character, Integer> countMap = new HashMap<>();
    
    for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
        countMap.put(c, countMap.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
    }
    
    for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
        if (countMap.get(c) == 1) {
            return c;
        }
    }
    return null;
}
```

### 2. **Check if a String is a Subsequence of Another String**

**Problem**: Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `s` is a subsequence of `t`. A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

**Approach**:
- Use two pointers: one for `s` and one for `t`. Traverse `t` and whenever you find a character in `t` that matches the character in `s`, move the pointer of `s`.

```java
public boolean isSubsequence(String s, String t) {
    int i = 0, j = 0;
    
    while (i < s.length() && j < t.length()) {
        if (s.charAt(i) == t.charAt(j)) {
            i++;
        }
        j++;
    }
    return i == s.length();
}
```

### 3. **Group Anagrams**

**Problem**: Given an array of strings, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

**Approach**:
- Use a hash map to group strings by their sorted version or frequency of characters.

```java
import java.util.*;

public List<List<String>> groupAnagrams(String[] strs) {
    Map<String, List<String>> map = new HashMap<>();
    
    for (String str : strs) {
        char[] chars = str.toCharArray();
        Arrays.sort(chars);
        String sortedStr = new String(chars);
        
        map.putIfAbsent(sortedStr, new ArrayList<>());
        map.get(sortedStr).add(str);
    }
    
    return new ArrayList<>(map.values());
}
```

### 4. **Find All Occurrences of a Substring**

**Problem**: Given a string `s` and a substring `sub`, find all the starting indices where the substring `sub` appears in `s`.

**Approach**:
- Use a sliding window or the `indexOf()` method in a loop to find all occurrences.

```java
import java.util.*;

public List<Integer> findSubstringOccurrences(String s, String sub) {
    List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
    int index = 0;
    
    while ((index = s.indexOf(sub, index)) != -1) {
        result.add(index);
        index++;
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

### 5. **Reverse Words in a String**

**Problem**: Given a string `s`, reverse the order of words in the string without reversing the characters in each word. The words are separated by a single space.

**Approach**:
- Split the string by spaces, reverse the list of words, and then join them back together.

```java
public String reverseWords(String s) {
    String[] words = s.trim().split("\\s+");
    StringBuilder reversed = new StringBuilder();
    
    for (int i = words.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        reversed.append(words[i]);
        if (i != 0) {
            reversed.append(" ");
        }
    }
    return reversed.toString();
}
```

### 6. **Valid Palindrome (Ignoring Non-Alphanumeric Characters)**

**Problem**: Given a string `s`, return `true` if it is a palindrome after removing all non-alphanumeric characters and converting to lowercase. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Approach**:
- Use two pointers to check if the string is the same forwards and backwards, ignoring non-alphanumeric characters.

```java
public boolean isPalindrome(String s) {
    int left = 0, right = s.length() - 1;
    
    while (left < right) {
        while (left < right && !Character.isLetterOrDigit(s.charAt(left))) left++;
        while (left < right && !Character.isLetterOrDigit(s.charAt(right))) right--;
        
        if (Character.toLowerCase(s.charAt(left)) != Character.toLowerCase(s.charAt(right))) {
            return false;
        }
        left++;
        right--;
    }
    
    return true;
}
```

### 7. **Check if a String is a Rotation of Another String**

**Problem**: Given two strings `s1` and `s2`, determine if `s2` is a rotation of `s1`. For example, `"waterbottle"` is a rotation of `"erbottlewat"`.

**Approach**:
- Concatenate `s1` with itself and check if `s2` is a substring of the concatenated string.

```java
public boolean isRotation(String s1, String s2) {
    if (s1.length() != s2.length()) {
        return false;
    }
    
    String concatenated = s1 + s1;
    return concatenated.contains(s2);
}
```

### 8. **Implement String `replaceAll()` Without Using Regex**

**Problem**: Implement your own version of the `replaceAll()` method that does not use regular expressions. You should replace all occurrences of a substring `old` with another substring `new`.

**Approach**:
- Traverse the string and replace the target substring when found.

```java
public String customReplaceAll(String str, String oldSubstring, String newSubstring) {
    StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
    int i = 0;
    
    while (i < str.length()) {
        if (i + oldSubstring.length() <= str.length() && str.substring(i, i + oldSubstring.length()).equals(oldSubstring)) {
            result.append(newSubstring);
            i += oldSubstring.length();
        } else {
            result.append(str.charAt(i));
            i++;
        }
    }
    
    return result.toString();
}
```

### 9. **Find the Longest Common Prefix**

**Problem**: Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings. If there is no common prefix, return an empty string.

**Approach**:
- Sort the strings and compare the first and last strings character by character.

```java
public String longestCommonPrefix(String[] strs) {
    if (strs == null || strs.length == 0) return "";
    
    Arrays.sort(strs);
    String first = strs[0];
    String last = strs[strs.length - 1];
    
    int i = 0;
    while (i < first.length() && i < last.length() && first.charAt(i) == last.charAt(i)) {
        i++;
    }
    
    return first.substring(0, i);
}
```

### 10. **Convert Roman to Integer**

**Problem**: Given a Roman numeral, convert it to an integer. Roman numerals are represented by seven symbols: `I, V, X, L, C, D, M`. For example, `"III"` is 3, `"IV"` is 4, and `"IX"` is 9.

**Approach**:
- Traverse the Roman numeral string and add/subtract values based on the order of the characters.

```java
public int romanToInt(String s) {
    Map<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    map.put('I', 1);
    map.put('V', 5);
    map.put('X', 10);
    map.put('L', 50);
    map.put('C', 100);
    map.put('D', 500);
    map.put('M', 1000);
    
    int total = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
        int current = map.get(s.charAt(i));
        if (i + 1 < s.length() && current < map.get(s.charAt(i + 1))) {
            total -= current;
        } else {
            total += current;
        }
    }
    return total;

11. ###  **Find the Smallest Window in a String that Contains All Characters of Another String**

**Problem**: Given two strings `s1` and `s2`, find the smallest window in `s1` that contains all the characters of `s2`. If no such window exists, return an empty string.

**Answer**:

- Use the **sliding window technique** to dynamically adjust the window size and track the counts of characters in `s2`.

```
import java.util.*;

public String minWindow(String s1, String s2) {
    if (s1.length() < s2.length()) return "";
    
    Map<Character, Integer> countMap = new HashMap<>();
    for (char c : s2.toCharArray()) {
        countMap.put(c, countMap.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
    }
    
    int left = 0, right = 0, minLength = Integer.MAX_VALUE, start = 0;
    int required = countMap.size();
    Map<Character, Integer> windowMap = new HashMap<>();
    
    while (right < s1.length()) {
        char c = s1.charAt(right);
        windowMap.put(c, windowMap.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
        
        if (windowMap.get(c).equals(countMap.get(c))) {
            required--;
        }
        
        while (required == 0) {
            if (right - left + 1 < minLength) {
                minLength = right - left + 1;
                start = left;
            }
            
            char leftChar = s1.charAt(left);
            windowMap.put(leftChar, windowMap.get(leftChar) - 1);
            if (windowMap.get(leftChar) < countMap.getOrDefault(leftChar, 0)) {
                required++;
            }
            left++;
        }
        
        right++;
    }
    
    return minLength == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? "" : s1.substring(start, start + minLength);
}

```
### Conclusion

These **medium-level string questions** cover a variety of scenarios, including basic string manipulation, pattern matching, and optimization techniques. They are great practice for sharpening your problem-solving skills and preparing for interviews. Be sure to explain your approach clearly and consider edge cases, as interviewers are often interested in how you think through problems as much as they are in the correctness of your solution.
