## **✅ CACHING INTERVIEW MASTER LIST**

  

_From basics to enterprise-level strategies — in-memory, distributed, annotations, and eviction_

---

### **🔹 1.** 

### **Why Caching? When to Cache?**

- Purpose of caching:
    
    - Reduce latency
        
    - Reduce database or API load
        
    - Improve scalability and performance
        
    
- What data should be cached:
    
    - Read-heavy data
        
    - Slow-changing data (e.g., configuration, metadata)
        
    - Expensive-to-compute results
        
    
- What **should not** be cached:
    
    - Highly dynamic or sensitive data
        
    - Large datasets with low access probability
        
    

  

🧠 _Q_: How do you decide what to cache in a payment or user-profile system?

---

### **🔹 2.** 

### **Types of Caches**

  

#### **🟢 In-Memory Caching:**

- Java Collections (e.g., Map)
    
- **Guava Cache** (Google’s caching lib)
    
- Caffeine (modern alternative to Guava)
    

  

#### **🟠 Distributed Caching:**

- **Redis**
    
- Hazelcast
    
- Memcached
    
- Apache Ignite
    

  

🧠 _Q_: Why use Redis over in-memory cache?

---

### **🔹 3.** 

### **Spring Boot Caching Annotations**

- @EnableCaching
    
- @Cacheable: caches method result
    
- @CachePut: updates cache after method execution
    
- @CacheEvict: clears cache (single/all entries)
    
- @Caching: group multiple caching behaviors
    
- key and condition expressions in SpEL
    
- Custom KeyGenerator
    

  

🧠 _Q_: What’s the difference between @CachePut and @Cacheable?

---

### **🔹 4.** 

### **Cache Configuration in Spring Boot**

- Configuring in application.yml
    
- Cache names and value types
    
- CacheManager options:
    
    - SimpleCacheManager (default)
        
    - RedisCacheManager
        
    - CaffeineCacheManager
        
    
- TTL configuration for entries
    
- Custom serialization/deserialization in Redis
    

  

🧠 _Q_: How do you configure Redis as cache backend in Spring Boot?

---

### **🔹 5.** 

### **Cache Invalidation Strategies**

- **Manual**: Evict entries explicitly
    
- **Time-based**:
    
    - TTL (Time to Live)
        
    - TTI (Time to Idle)
        
    
- **Write-through**: Update both DB and cache
    
- **Write-behind**: Async write to DB after updating cache
    
- **Cache-aside**:
    
    - Check cache → if miss → fetch from DB → store in cache
        
    
- **Refresh ahead**: Refresh data before TTL expiry
    

  

🧠 _Q_: Why is cache invalidation considered hard in distributed systems?

---

### **🔹 6.** 

### **Eviction Policies**

- **LRU (Least Recently Used)** — default in many systems
    
- **LFU (Least Frequently Used)** — good for hot data
    
- **FIFO (First In First Out)** — rarely used in high-perf systems
    
- **Random eviction**
    
- Hybrid strategies (e.g., Caffeine uses “Window TinyLFU”)
    

  

🧠 _Q_: How does Caffeine’s TinyLFU improve eviction accuracy?

---

### **🔹 7.** 

### **Concurrency & Consistency in Cache**

- Preventing **cache stampede** (mutex locking, background refresh)
    
- Handling **cache penetration** (cache nulls or error results)
    
- Avoiding **cache avalanche** (spread TTLs)
    
- Ensuring **read-after-write** consistency
    
- Versioning cache keys for safe rollouts
    

  

🧠 _Q_: How would you handle 10K cache expirations at the same time?

---

### **🔹 8.** 

### **Multi-level Caching**

- L1: Local (e.g., Guava) + L2: Distributed (e.g., Redis)
    
- Reduces latency while retaining shared consistency
    
- Managing coherence between L1 and L2
    
- Caffeine + Redis combo (Spring supports this manually)
    

  

🧠 _Q_: What are the trade-offs of using multi-level cache?

---

### **🔹 9.** 

### **Advanced Topics**

- Using @Cacheable with async methods
    
- Testing cache logic with JUnit/Mockito
    
- Cache metrics and monitoring
    
    - Cache hit/miss ratio
        
    - Eviction count
        
    - Size tracking
        
    
- Evicting by pattern (e.g., wildcard in Redis keys)
    
- Using Redis pub/sub to sync cache across services
    

  

🧠 _Q_: How do you track cache performance and usage?

---

### **🔹 10.** 

### **Real-World Caching Use Cases**

- Caching user preferences or profiles
    
- Product catalog (eCommerce)
    
- Token or session storage
    
- Rate limiters using Redis
    
- Leaderboard systems (sorted sets in Redis)
