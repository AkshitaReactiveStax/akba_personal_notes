## **✅ JAVA EXCEPTION HANDLING INTERVIEW MASTER LIST**

  

_Includes runtime vs compile-time, chaining, try-with-resources, custom logic, and JVM behavior_

---

### **🔹 1.** 

### **Types of Exceptions**

|**Type**|**Examples**|
|---|---|
|Checked (compile-time)|IOException, SQLException|
|Unchecked (runtime)|NullPointerException, IllegalArgumentException, IndexOutOfBoundsException|

- Errors (OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError) — not meant to be caught
    

  

🧠 _Q_: Why is IOException checked but NullPointerException not?

---

### **🔹 2.** 

### **try, catch, finally**

- finally block **always executes**, even after return
    
- finally is used to close resources, clean up memory
    
- Nested try blocks
    
- Catching multiple exception types using multi-catch:
    

```
catch (IOException | SQLException e)
```

  

  

🧠 _Q_: Will finally execute if System.exit(0) is called?

---

### **🔹 3.** 

### **throw vs throws**

- throw is used to **actually throw** an exception:
    

```
throw new IllegalArgumentException("msg");
```

-   
    
- throws is used in method declaration to indicate potential exception:
    

```
public void read() throws IOException
```

-   
    
- throw inside method → must match throws in signature if checked
    

  

🧠 _Q_: Can you throw a checked exception without declaring throws?

---

### **🔹 4.** 

### **Custom Exceptions**

- Extend Exception → checked
    
- Extend RuntimeException → unchecked
    
- Must call superclass constructor
    
- Add constructors with message, cause, both
    

  

🧠 _Q_: When would you create a checked custom exception?

---

### **🔹 5.** 

### **Suppressed Exceptions**

- Used in **try-with-resources**
    
- If exception is thrown in try and also in close(), the latter is suppressed
    
- Access via Throwable.getSuppressed()
    

  

🧠 _Q_: How do you retrieve suppressed exceptions from a thrown exception?

---

### **🔹 6.** 

### **Try-With-Resources**

- Auto-closes resources that implement AutoCloseable or Closeable
    
- Cleaner than finally block
    
- Can declare multiple resources in same try
    
- Works with files, DB connections, sockets
    

  

🧠 _Q_: What happens if both the try block and resource close() throw exceptions?

---

### **🔹 7.** 

### **Exception Propagation**

- Unhandled checked exceptions are propagated to the caller
    
- Call stack unwinding
    
- Order of catch blocks (specific → general)
    

  

🧠 _Q_: What happens if you catch Exception before IOException?

---

### **🔹 8.** 

### **Best Practices**

- Don’t catch Exception or Throwable unless really necessary
    
- Use specific exception types
    
- Avoid silent catches (catch (Exception e) {} with no logging)
    
- Avoid using exceptions for flow control
    
- Use logging inside catch blocks
    

  

🧠 _Q_: Why is catching Throwable considered a bad practice?

---

### **🔹 9.** 

### **Advanced Concepts**

- Re-throwing exceptions
    

```
catch (IOException e) {
    throw new CustomException("wrapped", e);
}
```

-   
    
- Exception chaining with initCause() or constructor
    
- Final vs finally vs finalize (very common interview trap)
    
- Checked exceptions in lambda expressions (how to work around)
    
Love the energy! Let’s crush the final section 💥

---


### **✅ 1.** 

### **Exception Chaining**

  

This means **wrapping one exception inside another** to preserve the root cause but give a domain-specific error.

```
try {
    readFromFile();
} catch (IOException e) {
    throw new DataLoadException("Failed to load data", e);
}
```

✅ Now, e.getCause() will return the original IOException.

---

### **✅ 2.** 

### **initCause() method**

  

Used when you can’t pass the cause in the constructor:

```
Throwable t = new Exception("Wrapper");
t.initCause(new IOException("Root cause"));
```

📌 Either pass cause via constructor _or_ use initCause() — **not both**.

---

### **✅ 3.** 

### **Re-throwing Exceptions**

  

You can catch an exception and throw it again (as-is or transformed):

```
try {
    doSomething();
} catch (IOException e) {
    log.error("Failed", e);
    throw e; // re-throwing
}
```

Or wrap it in a custom exception, as we saw earlier.

---

### **✅ 4.** 

### **final vs finally vs finalize**

|**Keyword**|**Purpose**|
|---|---|
|final|Prevent method/variable/class override|
|finally|Ensures cleanup, always runs|
|finalize()|Called before GC (deprecated, unreliable)|

❌ finalize() is **obsolete** and replaced by Cleaner / AutoCloseable.

---

### **✅ 5.** 

### **Checked Exceptions in Lambda Expressions (🔥 tricky)**

  

Lambdas **cannot throw checked exceptions** directly unless the functional interface declares them.

  

❌ Invalid:

```
list.forEach(item -> {
    throw new IOException(); // Compile error
});
```

✅ Workarounds:

  

**a. Use try-catch inside lambda**

```
list.forEach(item -> {
    try {
        readFile(item);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException(e); // Wrap it
    }
});
```

**b. Use a custom functional interface with throws in signature**

---

### **✅ 6.** 

### **Throwing exceptions from static blocks**

  

Yes, but only **unchecked exceptions**:

```
static {
    if (true) {
        throw new RuntimeException("Init failed"); // ✅ allowed
    }
}
```

Checked exceptions are not allowed here — compile-time error.

---

### **🧠 Q: Can you use checked exceptions inside** 

### **Stream.forEach()**

### **?**

  

**Answer:**

Not directly. Since Consumer<T> does **not allow checked exceptions**, you must:

- Catch inside the lambda, or
    
- Wrap the checked exception in a RuntimeException.
    

```
list.forEach(item -> {
    try {
        someMethodThatThrowsIOException(item);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new UncheckedIOException(e);
    }
});
```

---

### **✅ Final Pro Tip:**

  

In real-world apps:

- Exception wrapping gives **better stack traces**
    
- Chaining retains **root cause**
    
- Logging and meaningful messages make **debugging easy**

Absolutely! Here’s your **🔥 Java Exception Handling Interview Power Pack** — a master list of **tricky questions**, each followed by a detailed, interview-level explanation.

---

## **✅** 

## **MASTER TRICKY QUESTIONS – Exception Handling**

  

### **🔹** 

### **1. Types of Exceptions**

---

**Q1.** Why is IOException checked, but NullPointerException unchecked?

  

**Answer:**

Checked exceptions like IOException represent **recoverable conditions** (e.g. file not found), and Java wants to force you to handle them.

NullPointerException is due to **programming mistakes** (e.g. dereferencing null) and can’t be reasonably handled — so it’s unchecked.

---

**Q2.** Is it possible to catch Error? What happens if you do?

  

**Answer:**

Yes, syntactically you can catch Error, but it’s **discouraged**. Errors like OutOfMemoryError or StackOverflowError represent **critical JVM issues** and should not be handled in app logic — attempting to recover may lead to unstable state.

---

### **🔹** 

### **2. try-catch-finally**

---

**Q3.** What will the following code print?

```
public int test() {
    try {
        return 1;
    } catch (Exception e) {
        return 2;
    } finally {
        return 3;
    }
}
```

**Answer:** 3 — The finally block **overrides** any return from try or catch.

---

**Q4.** Will finally always execute?

  

**Answer:**

Yes, **unless**:

- System.exit() is called
    
- JVM crashes
    
- Hardware failure
    
    Otherwise, finally runs even after return, break, or continue.
    

---

### **🔹** 

### **3. throw vs throws**

---

**Q5.** Can you throw a checked exception without declaring throws?

  

**Answer:**

❌ No. You must either **handle it** using try-catch or **declare** it in method signature using throws.

Otherwise: **compile-time error**.

---

**Q6.** What’s the difference between throw new Exception() and throws Exception?

  

**Answer:**

- throw is used to **actually trigger** an exception at runtime.
    
- throws is used to **declare** that a method _might_ throw an exception.
    

---

### **🔹** 

### **4. Custom Exceptions**

---

**Q7.** When would you create a custom **checked** exception?

  

**Answer:**

When the client code is **expected to recover** from the issue.

Example: InsufficientBalanceException → gives calling code a chance to prompt the user to top up.

---

**Q8.** What’s the purpose of exception constructors taking Throwable cause?

  

**Answer:**

This allows **exception chaining**, preserving the original error’s stack trace when wrapping it in a domain-specific exception.

---

### **🔹** 

### **5. Suppressed Exceptions**

---

**Q9.** What happens if both try and close() throw exceptions in try-with-resources?

  

**Answer:**

- The exception from try is thrown.
    
- The exception from close() is **suppressed**.
    
- You can retrieve it using Throwable.getSuppressed().
    

---

**Q10.** Can you manually add suppressed exceptions?

  

**Answer:**

✅ Yes, using:

```
e.addSuppressed(new IOException("Suppressed"));
```

Usually done in custom resource management code or frameworks.

---

### **🔹** 

### **6. Try-With-Resources**

---

**Q11.** In what order are resources closed in a multi-resource try-with-resources block?

  

**Answer:**

In **reverse order** of declaration:

```
try (A a = new A(); B b = new B()) {
    // ...
}
```

Here, b.close() runs **before** a.close().

---

**Q12.** Can a try-with-resources block have a finally too?

  

**Answer:**

✅ Yes. You can use both.

But it’s **rare**, since resources are already auto-closed.

---

### **🔹** 

### **7. Exception Propagation**

---

**Q13.** What happens if you catch Exception before IOException?

  

**Answer:**

🚫 Compile-time error.

Java enforces catch blocks to go from **specific to general**.

---

**Q14.** What is call stack unwinding?

  

**Answer:**

It’s the process of **bubbling up** an unhandled exception from the method where it occurred, back through the caller chain until it’s caught or the program terminates.

---

### **🔹** 

### **8. Best Practices**

---

**Q15.** Why is it a bad practice to catch Throwable?

  

**Answer:**

Because it includes both Exception and Error.

Catching it may **swallow critical JVM errors** (e.g., OutOfMemoryError) that you should never try to recover from.

---

**Q16.** Why should you avoid empty catch blocks?

  

**Answer:**

They **hide bugs** and make debugging impossible. Always log or rethrow exceptions to keep visibility.

---

### **🔹** 

### **9. Advanced Concepts**

---

**Q17.** Can a lambda expression throw a checked exception?

  

**Answer:**

❌ No, unless the functional interface method declares it.

Otherwise, wrap it using try-catch or convert it to unchecked (RuntimeException).

---

**Q18.** Difference between final, finally, and finalize()?

|**Keyword**|**Meaning**|
|---|---|
|final|Prevent override/assignment|
|finally|Cleanup block|
|finalize()|Deprecated GC cleanup method|

⚠️ finalize() is obsolete in modern Java.

---

**Q19.** Can you throw an exception from a static initializer block?

  

**Answer:**

✅ Yes, but only **unchecked exceptions** (RuntimeException).

```
static {
    throw new RuntimeException("Init failed");
}
```

Checked exceptions here cause compile-time error.

---

**Q20.** What’s the difference between exception chaining and rethrowing?

- **Chaining:** Wrapping original exception inside a custom one.
    
- **Rethrowing:** Throwing the same exception again (often after logging or partially handling it).
    

---

Would you like me to turn this into a **printable study PDF** or quiz version next? Or go for **mock interview questions** by phase with increasing difficulty?



Absolutely — let’s break it down **cleanly and practically**, especially from the **perspective of designing a robust Java framework** (like JDBC or an HTTP client).


## **When to use Suppressed Exceptions vs Exception Chaining**

### **🧵 1. Exception Chaining — when the root problem is in another layer**

### **✅ Use Exception Chaining when:**

  

> You want to wrap a **low-level exception** (from a utility or third-party lib) into a **higher-level business or framework exception**, while preserving the root cause.

  

#### **📌 Example Scenario:**

  

You’re writing a JDBC-style framework and want to abstract away SQLException from end-users:

```
try {
    db.executeQuery();
} catch (SQLException e) {
    throw new DataAccessException("Failed to execute DB query", e); // CHAINED
}
```

✅ The **real cause (SQLException)** is preserved via e.getCause()

✅ But your framework now throws **semantic exceptions**: DataAccessException, InvalidQueryException, etc.

---

### **💡 Key Traits of Exception Chaining:**

- Used in **wrapping**
    
- One primary exception
    
- Original is accessible via getCause()
    
- Excellent for **API abstraction** and **layer separation**
    

---

### **✅** 

### **🧯 2. Suppressed Exceptions — when multiple failures occur simultaneously**

---

### **✅ Use Suppressed Exceptions when:**

  

> More than one exception is thrown, but you must **pick one to throw** and **retain the rest without losing them**.

  

#### **📌 Example Scenario:**

  

You’re writing an HTTP client and:

- A request fails (IOException)
    
- But when trying to **close the socket**, another error occurs (SocketException)
    

```
try (Socket socket = new Socket("api.example.com", 80)) {
    throw new IOException("Request failed");
} 
// Socket.close() throws SocketException internally
```

✅ Java will throw the IOException,

✅ The SocketException will be **suppressed**, accessible via getSuppressed()

---

### **💡 Key Traits of Suppressed Exceptions:**

- Happens during **resource cleanup**
    
- **Primary exception is thrown**, others are attached via addSuppressed()
    
- Happens **automatically** with try-with-resources
    
- Important when multiple things can fail, but only **one can be thrown**
    

---

## **🔄 Summary Table**

|**Use Case**|**Use Chaining**|**Use Suppressed Exceptions**|
|---|---|---|
|Wrapping 1 exception with context|✅ Yes|❌ Not suitable|
|Multiple simultaneous failures|❌ Only captures 1|✅ Retain secondary (cleanup) errors|
|Custom domain exception layering|✅ Semantic abstraction|❌ Not relevant|
|Auto-cleanup in try-with-resources|❌ Not needed|✅ Happens automatically|
|Best used when?|You want to **translate** exceptions|You want to **preserve all causes**|

---

### **🎯 Real-world analogy:**

- **Chaining = replacing** the label but keeping the cause inside.
    
    _“Transaction failed” (because of: SQL error)_
    
- **Suppressed = stacking** the other issues underneath.
    
    _“Main issue: payment failed, but also couldn’t close database”_
