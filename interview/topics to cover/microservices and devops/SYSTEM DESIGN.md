## **âœ… SYSTEM DESIGN BASICS (JAVA BACKEND CONTEXT) â€“ INTERVIEW MASTER LIST**

---

### **ðŸ”¹ 1.**Â 

### **System Design Fundamentals**

- **Functional vs Non-Functional Requirements**

ðŸ§  _Q_: What are the non-functional requirements of a chat app?

---

### **ðŸ”¹ 2.**Â 

### **Scalability Principles**

- **Horizontal scaling** (scale-out) vs **Vertical scaling** (scale-up)
    
- **Elasticity** (auto-scaling)
    
- Scalability bottlenecks: database, queue, disk I/O, CPU
    
- Stateless services + scaling replicas
    
- Distributed sessions using Redis
    

  

ðŸ§  _Q_: Why does statelessness help in horizontal scaling?

---

### **ðŸ”¹ 3.**Â 

### **Load Balancing**

- Client-side vs Server-side load balancing
    
- L4 (TCP-based) vs L7 (HTTP-based) load balancers
    
- Sticky sessions vs Round-robin vs Least-connections
    
- Health checks
    
- Load balancing with:
    
    - NGINX
        
    - AWS ALB/ELB
        
    - Spring Cloud LoadBalancer
        
    

  

ðŸ§  _Q_: How does a load balancer detect a failing service?

---

### **ðŸ”¹ 4.**Â 

### **Service Discovery**

- Why we need it in microservices
    
- Centralized (Eureka, Consul) vs DNS-based (Kubernetes)
    
- Heartbeats, TTL, stale instance eviction
    
- Registry-client architecture
    
- Sidecar pattern
    

  

ðŸ§  _Q_: How does service discovery work in Spring Cloud with Eureka?

---

### **ðŸ”¹ 5.**Â 

### **Caching**

- Cache-Aside vs Write-Through vs Write-Behind
    
- Distributed caching: Redis, Memcached
    
- Local caching: Caffeine, Guava
    
- TTL (Time To Live) and cache invalidation
    
- Consistency strategies (stale-while-revalidate, versioned cache)
    
- Preventing cache stampede and avalanche
    

  

ðŸ§  _Q_: Whatâ€™s the difference between Redis LRU and LFU eviction?

---

### **ðŸ”¹ 6.**Â 

### **Database Design & Partitioning**

- RDBMS vs NoSQL (when to choose)
    
- Sharding:
    
    - Range-based, Hash-based, Geo-sharding
        
    
- Read replicas & replication
    
- Denormalization for performance
    
- Data modeling with eventual consistency
    

  

ðŸ§  _Q_: How do you ensure consistency across shards?

---

### **ðŸ”¹ 7.**Â 

### **CAP Theorem**

- C = Consistency
    
- A = Availability
    
- P = Partition tolerance
    
- CA, CP, AP trade-offs
    
- Real-world examples:
    
    - CP: Zookeeper, MongoDB (majority writes)
        
    - AP: Couchbase, Cassandra
        
    

  

ðŸ§  _Q_: What type of system is Kafka in the CAP triangle?

---

### **ðŸ”¹ 8.**Â 

### **Fault Tolerance & High Availability**

- Redundancy (active-active, active-passive)
    
- Timeouts, retries, circuit breakers
    
- Heartbeat checks and failover
    
- Retry strategies (exponential backoff, jitter)
    
- Rate limiting and bulkheads
    
- Graceful degradation (fallback responses)
    

  

ðŸ§  _Q_: What happens if one node in a payment service fails mid-request?

---

### **ðŸ”¹ 9.**Â 

### **Design Patterns in System Design**

- **Event-driven architecture**
    
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**
    
- **Event Sourcing**
    
- **Saga pattern** for distributed transactions
    
- **Strangler pattern** for monolith to microservice migration
    

  

ðŸ§  _Q_: Why use Saga over 2PC in distributed services?

---

### **ðŸ”¹ 10.**Â 

### **Asynchronous Communication**

- Message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ)
    
- Event Bus vs Message Broker
    
- Pub-Sub vs Point-to-Point
    
- Eventual consistency design
    
- Message deduplication & idempotency
    

  

ðŸ§  _Q_: How do you handle duplicate events in a payment flow?

---

### **ðŸ”¹ 11.**Â 

### **Security in System Design**

- Authentication (OAuth2, JWT, SSO)
    
- Authorization (RBAC, ABAC)
    
- API gateways as central auth
    
- Rate limiting & throttling
    
- Data encryption (in-transit & at-rest)
    

  

ðŸ§  _Q_: How do you secure communication between microservices?

---

### **ðŸ”¹ 12.**Â 

### **Common System Design Use Cases**

- URL shortener
    
- Chat application
    
- Payment gateway
    
- Netflix-style video streaming
    
- Uber-like location tracking
    
- Rate limiter or notification system
    
- Online judge/code compiler
    

  

ðŸ§  _Q_: How would you ensure uniqueness in a URL shortener?
