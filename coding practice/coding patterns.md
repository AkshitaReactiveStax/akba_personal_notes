Great question! Knowing how to approach coding problems using **problem-solving patterns** and **strategies** is a game-changer for interviews and competitive programming. Let me break it down for you:

---

## **✅** 

## **Top Problem-Solving Patterns**
These are common **templates** or **approaches** to solve problems effectively:
### **1.** 

### **Two Pointers**

  

Used when dealing with arrays or strings. You maintain two pointers that move towards each other or in tandem.

- ✅ **Use when**: Sorted arrays, subarrays, reversing, finding pairs.
    
- **Examples**:
    
    - Reverse a string
        
    - Two Sum in a sorted array
        
    - Container with most water
        
    

### **2.** 

### **Sliding Window**

You maintain a “window” over a subset of data and slide it across the input to find the optimal result.

- ✅ **Use when**: You need to find subarrays or substrings (max/min/average).
    
- **Examples**:
    
    - Longest substring without repeating characters
        
    - Maximum sum of k consecutive elements
        
    
### **3.** 

### **Fast & Slow Pointers (Tortoise-Hare)**

Common for cycle detection in linked lists or arrays.

- ✅ **Use when**: Cycle detection, intersection points.
    
- **Examples**:
    
    - Linked list cycle
        
    - Happy number
        
### **4.** 

### **Hash Map / Set**
Use a hash map or set to track occurrences, duplicates, or index mappings.

- ✅ **Use when**: Frequency counting, avoiding duplicates, fast lookup.
    
- **Examples**:
    
    - Two Sum
        
    - Longest consecutive sequence
        
### **5.** 

### **Prefix Sum / Cumulative Sum*

Preprocess the input to calculate the sum of a range efficiently.

- ✅ **Use when**: Sum of subarrays, differences, or range updates.
    
- **Examples**:
    
    - Subarray sum equals K
        
    - Range sum query
        
    

### **6.** 

### **Binary Search**

Divide and conquer on sorted data or search space.

- ✅ **Use when**: Sorted arrays, monotonic conditions, min/max problems.
    
- **Examples**:
    
    - Find element in sorted array
        
    - Search in rotated array
        
    - Find minimum in a mountain array
        
    
### **7.** 

### **Backtracking**
Explore all possibilities recursively and backtrack when a condition fails.

- ✅ **Use when**: Combinations, permutations, constraints.
    
- **Examples**:
    
    - Sudoku solver
        
    - N-Queens
        
    - Subset sum
        
    
### **8.** 

### **Depth/Breadth First Search (DFS/BFS)**
Used to explore all nodes/paths in a graph/tree.

- ✅ **Use when**: Graph traversal, path finding, connected components.
    
- **Examples**:
    
    - Maze problems
        
    - Clone a graph
        
    - Number of islands
        
    
### **9.** 

### **Dynamic Programming (DP)**
Break down a problem into overlapping subproblems and store intermediate results.

- ✅ **Use when**: Optimal substructure, overlapping subproblems.
    
- **Examples**:
    
    - Fibonacci
        
    - Knapsack
        
    - Longest Common Subsequence
        
    

---

### **10.** 

### **Greedy**
Make the locally optimal choice at each step and hope it leads to the global optimum.

- ✅ **Use when**: Optimization problems where greedy leads to correct result.
    
- **Examples**:
    
    - Activity selection
        
    - Coin change (if coins are canonical)
        
    - Huffman encoding
        
    

---

### **11.** 

### **Bit Manipulation**
Use bitwise operators for optimization or solving tricky math problems.

- ✅ **Use when**: You deal with integers, subsets, toggles.
    
- **Examples**:
    
    - Single number
        
    - Counting bits
        
    - Subset generation

2. **Identify input/output and constraints**
    
3. **Look for patterns** in examples
    
4. **Choose the right strategy** (from above)
    
5. **Write pseudocode or dry-run**
    
6. **Code it**
    
7. **Test edge cases**
