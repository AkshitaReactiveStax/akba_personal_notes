## **JAVA EXCEPTION HANDLING â€“ 50 MASTER INTERVIEW QUESTIONS + DETAILED ANSWERS**

---

### **ðŸ”¹**Â 

### **SECTION 1: Core Concepts (1â€“10)**

---

**1. What is the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions in Java?**

**Answer:**

Checked exceptions are those that the compiler forces you to handle explicitly, either by using a try-catch block or declaring them using throws. They represent **recoverable conditions** (e.g., IOException, SQLException).

Unchecked exceptions are subclasses of RuntimeException and are **not checked** at compile time. They represent **programming errors** (e.g., NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException).

---

**2. Why is IOException a checked exception but NullPointerException is unchecked?**

**Answer:**

IOException involves external resources (like files or networks) and is recoverable â€” it forces developers to handle such situations. NullPointerException, however, indicates a flaw in program logic (accessing an object that is null), and Java expects the developer to fix the code instead of handling it.

---

**3. Can we catch Throwable in Java? Is it a good practice?**

**Answer:**

Yes, you can catch Throwable, which is the superclass of both Exception and Error. However, itâ€™s a **bad practice** because it includes serious system-level Errors (e.g., OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError) that the application cannot recover from. Catching them may cause more damage or hide critical issues.

---

**4. What is the difference between throw and throws?**

**Answer:**

- throw is used to **actually throw** an instance of a Throwable.
    
- throws is used in method declarations to **declare potential exceptions** that a method may throw.
    
    Example:
    

```
public void readFile() throws IOException {
    throw new IOException("File error");
}
```

---

**5. Can you throw a checked exception without declaring throws?**

**Answer:**

No. If you throw a checked exception, it must either be caught inside the method using try-catch or declared in the method signature using throws. Failing to do either causes a compile-time error.

---

**6. What is the purpose of the finally block?**

**Answer:**

The finally block is used to define code that **must execute regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not** â€” typically used for resource cleanup (e.g., closing files, database connections). Even if try returns or throws, finally still runs â€” unless the JVM shuts down (e.g., System.exit(0)).

---

**7. What happens if both try and finally blocks have return statements?**

**Answer:**

The return in the finally block **overrides** the return in the try or catch block. This is a common interview trap.

Example:

```
public int test() {
    try {
        return 1;
    } finally {
        return 2;
    }
}
// Output: 2
```

---

**8. What is exception propagation in Java?**

**Answer:**

Exception propagation is the process by which an **unhandled exception** moves up the call stack until it is caught or the program terminates. If a method throws an exception and doesnâ€™t handle it, it propagates to its caller, and so on.

---

**9. Can we have a try block without a catch block?**

**Answer:**

Yes, but only if you include a finally block. A try block **must** be followed by at least one catch or one finally block.

---

**10. Can static blocks throw exceptions?**

**Answer:**

They can throw **unchecked exceptions**, but **not checked exceptions** unless they are caught inside the block.

Example:

```
static {
    throw new RuntimeException("Allowed");
}
```

---

### **ðŸ”¹**Â 

### **SECTION 2: Custom and Advanced Exceptions (11â€“20)**

---

**11. How do you create a custom checked exception in Java?**

**Answer:**

Extend the Exception class and add constructors that call super(message) and super(message, cause) for chaining.

```
public class DataLoadException extends Exception {
    public DataLoadException(String msg, Throwable cause) {
        super(msg, cause);
    }
}
```

---

**12. Whatâ€™s the purpose of exception chaining?**

**Answer:**

Exception chaining preserves the **original cause** of an exception while allowing you to wrap it in a higher-level, domain-specific exception. This improves **error clarity** and debugging.

---

**13. Can you manually add suppressed exceptions in Java?**

**Answer:**

Yes, using Throwable.addSuppressed(Throwable). This is useful when managing multiple resources manually (e.g., in a finally block) to simulate the behavior of try-with-resources.

---

**14. What are suppressed exceptions and when do they occur?**

**Answer:**

Suppressed exceptions occur when:

- An exception is thrown in the try block.
    
- Another is thrown during resource cleanup (close()).
    
    Java throws the **first exception** and attaches the others using getSuppressed().
    

---

**15. What is try-with-resources and how is it better than finally?**

**Answer:**

try-with-resources is a feature that automatically closes resources that implement AutoCloseable. Itâ€™s better than finally because:

- It avoids boilerplate code.
    
- It handles suppressed exceptions automatically.
    
- It guarantees deterministic resource management.
    

---

**16. What happens if only close() throws an exception in try-with-resources?**

**Answer:**

The close() exception becomes the **primary exception**, and is thrown directly â€” nothing is suppressed unless there was another competing exception from the try block.

---

**17. Whatâ€™s the difference between IOException and IOError?**

**Answer:**

- IOException is a **checked exception** for recoverable I/O failures.
    
- IOError is an **unchecked error**, indicating **catastrophic failures** (e.g., disk corruption), typically unrecoverable.
    

---

**18. Can exceptions be thrown from a constructor?**

**Answer:**

Yes. Constructors can throw both checked and unchecked exceptions. If checked, they must declare throws in the signature.

---

**19. What is the difference between final, finally, and finalize()?**

**Answer:**

- final: keyword to prevent override.
    
- finally: block that always executes.
    
- finalize(): deprecated method called by GC before object removal (avoid using it).
    

---

**20. What is the role of initCause() method?**

**Answer:**

It sets the cause of an exception after the object is constructed. Itâ€™s useful when:

- You canâ€™t use the constructor with Throwable
    
- But still want to link the original cause
    

---

### **SECTION 3: Scenario-Based Tricky Questions (21â€“35)**

---

**21. What will this print? Why?**

```
public static int test() {
    try {
        return 1;
    } catch (Exception e) {
        return 2;
    } finally {
        return 3;
    }
}
```

**Answer:**

The output is 3. The return statement in the finally block **overrides** any return from try or catch. This is a common trap in interviews.

---

**22. What happens if try throws an exception and close() also fails in try-with-resources?**

  

**Answer:**

- The exception from try becomes the **primary exception**.
    
- The exception from close() is attached using addSuppressed() and accessible via getSuppressed().
    
    This ensures that **no exception is lost**, which often happens in manual cleanup.
    

---

**23. In manual try-finally, if both try and finally throw exceptions, which one survives?**

  

**Answer:**

The exception in the finally block **overrides** the exception from the try block. The original exception is **lost** unless you manually store and rethrow it (or use addSuppressed()).

---

**24. What is the output of this code?**

```
try {
    throw new Exception("Main");
} catch (Exception e) {
    throw new RuntimeException("Wrapper");
} finally {
    throw new RuntimeException("Final");
}
```

**Answer:**

Only RuntimeException("Final") is thrown. The one from the catch is **overridden** by finally. The original Exception("Main") is also lost.

---

**25. How would you safely close multiple resources without try-with-resources?**

  

**Answer:**

Youâ€™d use a finally block with nested try-catch to catch and log any exceptions from each close() individually. Alternatively, you can track them manually and use addSuppressed() to simulate what try-with-resources does.

---

**26. You are writing a file parser. If parsing fails, you throw InvalidFileFormatException. Should it be checked or unchecked?**

  

**Answer:**

If the caller can **recover or retry** with a new file, make it a **checked exception**. If itâ€™s a programming error (e.g., malformed static file in code), use an **unchecked exception**.

---

**27. Can a finally block suppress an exception thrown in try?**

  

**Answer:**

Yes. If the finally block contains a return or another exception, it **suppresses the exception from try** unless you explicitly handle and rethrow the original one.

---

**28. Whatâ€™s wrong with this code?**

```
try {
    // risky logic
} catch (Exception e) {
    // do nothing
}
```

**Answer:**

Silent catch blocks are a huge red flag. Swallowing exceptions without logging or recovery leads to **silent failures**, making debugging impossible. You should **always log or handle** exceptions meaningfully.

---

**29. What happens if System.exit(0) is called inside a try block? Will finally execute?**

  

**Answer:**

No. System.exit(0) terminates the JVM immediately. The finally block is **skipped**, making this one of the **few ways** to prevent finally from executing.

---

**30. You catch Exception before IOException. What happens?**

  

**Answer:**

Compilation error. Java requires that **specific exceptions** be caught before **general ones** (like Exception) to avoid unreachable code.

---

**31. Can you use throws with main()?**

  

**Answer:**

Yes. For example:

```
public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException
```

This allows you to let exceptions propagate to the JVM, which will print the stack trace and terminate the program.

---

**32. What happens if you donâ€™t handle or declare a checked exception?**

  

**Answer:**

The compiler throws an error. Java enforces handling of checked exceptions to ensure that developers **anticipate and manage recoverable failures**.

---

**33. How does Java handle multiple exceptions in a multi-catch block?**

  

**Answer:**

Java allows catching unrelated exceptions using catch (IOException | SQLException e).

The variable e is **implicitly final** â€” you cannot reassign it inside the catch block.

---

**34. How are suppressed exceptions retrieved and logged?**

  

**Answer:**

```
catch (Exception e) {
    for (Throwable suppressed : e.getSuppressed()) {
        logger.error("Suppressed: ", suppressed);
    }
}
```

You use getSuppressed() to view cleanup failures attached to the primary thrown exception.

---

**35. Why shouldnâ€™t we catch Error or Throwable in business logic?**

  

**Answer:**

They signal **serious system failures** (e.g., memory exhaustion, VM errors) that app logic should not attempt to recover from. Catching them can lead to **corrupted program state** or masked critical failures.

---

### **SECTION 4: Best Practices and Deep Design Insights (36â€“50)**

---

**36. What is exception wrapping and why is it useful?**

  

**Answer:**

Exception wrapping (a.k.a. exception chaining) is the act of throwing a **new exception** with a **cause** (original exception) so you can:

- Add context
    
- Hide implementation details
    
- Maintain stack trace
    

---

**37. Should we use exceptions for control flow?**

  

**Answer:**

No. Exceptions are costly in terms of performance and are meant for **exceptional circumstances**, not regular logic. Use if/else or return values for expected outcomes.

---

**38. Can lambda expressions throw checked exceptions?**

  

**Answer:**

Not directly, unless the functional interface declares throws. To work around this, you can:

- Use try-catch inside the lambda
    
- Wrap the checked exception in an unchecked one (like RuntimeException)
    

---

**39. Can we have multiple catch blocks for the same try?**

  

**Answer:**

Yes. Each catch block must handle a **different exception type**, and should be ordered **from specific to general** to avoid unreachable code.

---

**40. How do you design exception handling in a layered application?**

  

**Answer:**

- Wrap low-level exceptions in **custom domain exceptions** (e.g., InvalidOrderException)
    
- Log in the **lowest layer** that has enough context
    
- Avoid leaking implementation details (e.g., SQLException) to higher layers
    

---

**41. Why is it better to throw a custom exception than using RuntimeException directly?**

  

**Answer:**

Custom exceptions improve **readability**, **traceability**, and allow fine-grained **handling**. A generic RuntimeException provides no semantic meaning and makes the code harder to understand and maintain.

---

**42. Whatâ€™s the difference between re-throwing and wrapping an exception?**

  

**Answer:**

- Re-throwing (throw e) passes the exact exception up the stack.
    
- Wrapping creates a new exception (new CustomException("msg", e)) while preserving the original as a cause â€” helpful for **abstraction and context**.
    

---

**43. How would you catch and handle multiple resources failing in finally?**

  

**Answer:**

Youâ€™d use a nested try-catch per resource, or track all failures and **manually attach suppressed exceptions** using addSuppressed().

---

**44. What is the purpose of AutoCloseable vs Closeable?**

  

**Answer:**

Closeable is older and throws only IOException.

AutoCloseable (Java 7+) is more generic â€” close() can throw **any exception**. Itâ€™s used in **try-with-resources** blocks.

---

**45. Can you mix try-with-resources and finally?**

  

**Answer:**

Yes. But usually unnecessary unless you need to clean up **non-AutoCloseable** resources or perform logic that doesnâ€™t involve resource cleanup.

---

**46. How does exception handling differ in constructors vs methods?**

  

**Answer:**

Both can throw exceptions. If a constructor fails, the object is **not created**. Any partially initialized state is discarded. Methods can throw exceptions as part of normal program flow.

---

**47. What happens if a method declares throws Exception, but throws only a RuntimeException inside?**

  

**Answer:**

Itâ€™s legal but misleading. Declaring throws Exception suggests a checked exception is expected. Prefer declaring only what is actually thrown.

---

**48. Whatâ€™s the purpose of exception hierarchies in large systems?**

  

**Answer:**

Hierarchies allow:

- Catching related failures using a common superclass
    
- Consistent logging and handling
    
- Cleaner APIs and error reporting
    

---

**49. Whatâ€™s the danger of catching Exception at the top of every method?**

  

**Answer:**

- Hides bugs
    
- Makes debugging harder
    
- Leads to poor error reporting
    
    You should catch only **specific**, expected exceptions and allow unknown ones to **propagate** to centralized error handlers.
    

---

**50. How do frameworks like Spring handle exceptions?**

  

**Answer:**

Spring encourages throwing **unchecked exceptions** and handles them centrally using:

- @ControllerAdvice
    
- @ExceptionHandler
    
    This allows **global exception mapping** to HTTP responses or logs, improving consistency and separation of concerns.
