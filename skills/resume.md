### **Microservices API Projects – Mizuho Financial Group, US**

  

**Role:** Backend Developer (Contract)

**Duration:** Aug 2023 – Sept 2024

**Location:** Remote / Onsite (as applicable)

  

Worked as part of the Banking Division at Mizuho Financial Group, contributing to multiple modernization efforts involving the company’s mortgage and credit service platforms. Focused on developing scalable, containerized microservices using Java and Spring Boot as part of a large enterprise team, collaborating across cross-functional squads including QA, DevOps, and Product.

  

#### **Key Responsibilities and Achievements:**

- **Microservices Development:**
    
    - Designed and implemented RESTful APIs using **Spring Boot** as part of a microservices architecture aimed at modernizing legacy systems across mortgage and credit operations.
        
    - Created modular service components to support specific banking functions such as credit checks, mortgage rate calculations, and internal customer lookups.
        
    - Ensured services were stateless, scalable, and loosely coupled to facilitate rapid development and independent deployments.
        
    
- **Credit Check API:**
    
    - Contributed to the **Credit Check API**, which integrates with third-party credit bureaus (such as **Equifax’s test sandbox**) to fetch and process external credit reports.
        
    - Built REST endpoints to expose API functionality to internal platforms and banking products.
        
    - Implemented robust request validation logic and structured JSON response formatting to support multiple client consumers including frontend dashboards and mobile apps.
        
    - Integrated with internal customer profile systems to enhance decision-making logic and reduce response time for credit approvals.
        
    
- **Mortgage Calculator API:**
    
    - Assisted in the design and implementation of the **Mortgage Calculator API**, responsible for calculating mortgage rate quotes, amortization schedules, and payment breakdowns.
        
    - Integrated the API with real-time backend rate services and provided failover logic for degraded upstream availability.
        
    - Supported data enrichment by collaborating with rate engine teams and business analysts to incorporate dynamic rate tiers, insurance fees, and location-based adjustments.
        
    - Delivered performant REST endpoints accessible from the web and mobile banking applications.
        
    
- **Backend Technologies & Databases:**
    
    - Utilized **Spring Boot** and **Java 17** for backend development, focusing on service reliability, exception handling, and efficient use of memory and threads.
        
    - Wrote optimized queries for **MongoDB** (for flexible document storage) and **Oracle SQL** (for transactional, relational data).
        
    - Modified schema definitions to support new service features and handled migration scripts during upgrades.
        
    - Addressed common error scenarios such as data inconsistencies, retry logic for transient failures, and graceful fallbacks for missing external dependencies.
        
    
- **Containerization & Deployment:**
    
    - Containerized services using **Docker**, created custom Dockerfiles, and managed container lifecycle for multiple environments.
        
    - Worked extensively with **OpenShift Kubernetes** to deploy, scale, and monitor microservices in production and staging clusters.
        
    - Collaborated with DevOps engineers to manage and improve **CI/CD pipelines**, contributing to **Jenkinsfiles** for job automation and refining deployment configurations.
        
    - Participated in managing pipelines via **Harness**, focusing on promotion strategies, rollback procedures, and blue-green deployments.
        
    
- **Testing & Quality Assurance:**
    
    - Implemented unit testing coverage using **JUnit 5** and **Mockito**, writing test cases for business logic, exception flows, and controller-layer behavior.
        
    - Participated in peer code reviews to enforce code quality, readability, and architectural consistency.
        
    - Developed basic integration and end-to-end tests using **Karate DSL**, enabling automated regression testing for critical service flows.
        
    - Used **Postman** to test API endpoints during local development and to create shared API documentation for QA and frontend teams.
        
    
- **Frontend Integration & Legacy Support:**
    
    - Supported limited frontend integration using **React 15.x** and **Jest**, mainly by assisting frontend teams with API interface contracts, mock data, and troubleshooting.
        
    - Provided backward compatibility for certain APIs to ensure smooth deprecation of legacy SOAP services and coordinated versioning strategy across releases.
        
    
- **Collaboration & Agile Practices:**
    
    - Operated within a **Scrum-based Agile framework**, attending and contributing to daily stand-ups, sprint planning, retrospectives, and backlog grooming sessions.
        
    - Used **JIRA** for story tracking, defect reporting, sprint management, and documentation.
        
    - Interfaced with QA, product owners, security teams, and DevOps leads to facilitate transparent communication and timely delivery of milestones.
        
    - Participated in sprint demos to showcase progress and receive feedback from stakeholders.
        
    
- **Kafka & Messaging:**
    
    - Gained exposure to **Apache Kafka** for asynchronous messaging use cases, especially around audit logging and downstream notifications.
        
    - Participated in setting up basic Kafka consumers for testing purposes and supported integration with credit event queues.
        
    
- **Version Control & Collaboration Tools:**
    
    - Used **Git** (Bitbucket/GitHub Enterprise) for source control; followed Gitflow workflows, resolved merge conflicts, and participated in pull request reviews.
        
    - Maintained internal Confluence pages for documenting service endpoints, setup instructions, and team onboarding guides.
