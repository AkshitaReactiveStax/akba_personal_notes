**why do we need to  set the instance of another class in the constructor of a class ?**

  In object-oriented programming (OOP), setting an instance of another class inside the constructor of a class is a common practice for a few reasons:

1. **Dependency Injection**: When one class depends on another to perform its work, you pass an instance of that dependent class through the constructor. This is called _constructor injection_ and helps with:

• **Modularity**: You can easily swap out the dependent class without modifying the main class.

• **Testability**: You can inject mock or test objects, making unit testing easier.

2. **Encapsulation of Logic**: If your class relies on functionality from another class, passing an instance in the constructor encapsulates that dependency. This keeps your code organized and promotes single responsibility, meaning each class focuses on one concern.

3. **Reuse**: By passing an instance via the constructor, you can reuse the same instance of the dependent class across different parts of your project without needing to recreate it, which saves resources.

  

	  ##### Question :  in my code logic , i can choose to not use random as the mode of distribution is configurable through the application properties , random or round-robin. So my question is if i set random's instance in the constructor of the TradeDistributorService and my current mode is round-robin, and  not random, should i still set it in the constructor ?and also if your answer is yes ,  every time an object of TradeDistributorService is created, the random instance is ready to generate random values , when it's not even being used ?

  

	In your case, where the mode of distribution (random or round-robin) is configurable, it wouldn’t make sense to always initialize the Random instance in the constructor if you’re not using it in certain modes like round-robin. Initializing it when it’s not needed adds unnecessary overhead, especially if the object is not used.

  

**Best Practice:**

  

Instead of initializing the Random instance every time the TradeDistributorService is created, you could follow a **lazy initialization** approach, or initialize it **conditionally**, only when the random mode is selected.

  

Here are a few options:

  

**1. Conditional Initialization in the Constructor:**

You can modify the constructor to check the mode before initializing random:  
  



```
private Random random;

private String distributionMode;

  public TradeDistributorService(String distributionMode) {
    this.distributionMode = distributionMode;

    if (distributionMode.equalsIgnoreCase("random")) {
		this.random = new Random(); // Only initialize if the mode is 'random'

    }

}  
```
  
This way, the random instance is only created when you actually need it (i.e., when the mode is set to random).

  

**2. Lazy Initialization:**

  Another approach is to initialize random only when you actually need it in the logic, rather than in the constructor. For example:  
  


```
    private Random random;

	public Random getRandomInstance() {
		if (this.random == null) {

        this.random = new Random(); // Initialize only when it's first needed

    }

    return random;

}

```
  

  
This ensures that the random object is created only if you need to use it.

  

**3. Separate Strategies for Each Mode (Strategy Pattern):**

  

You could also implement the **Strategy Pattern**, where you create separate classes for random distribution and round-robin distribution, and inject the appropriate strategy based on the configuration.  
  
  
```
public interface DistributionStrategy {

    void distribute();

}

  
public class RandomDistribution implements DistributionStrategy {
 private Random random = new Random();

    @Override
	public void distribute() {

        // Random distribution logic
    }

}

  

public class RoundRobinDistribution implements DistributionStrategy {

    @Override
	public void distribute() {

        // Round-robin distribution logic
    }

}

  

public class TradeDistributorService {

    private DistributionStrategy distributionStrategy;

    public TradeDistributorService(DistributionStrategy distributionStrategy) {

        this.distributionStrategy = distributionStrategy;

    }


    public void distributeTrades() {

        distributionStrategy.distribute();

    }

}  
  
```
In this case, you choose the appropriate strategy at runtime (random or round-robin), and there’s no need to initialize unused objects like Random when they’re not required.
