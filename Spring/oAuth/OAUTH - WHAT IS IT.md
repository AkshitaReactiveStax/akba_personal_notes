**What is OAuth 2.0 and Why Do We Use It?**

**1. What is OAuth?**
OAuth 2.0 (Open Authorization) is an **authorization framework** that allows third-party applications to access a user’s resources **without exposing their credentials (username & password).**

🔹 **Key Purpose:** It enables **secure, delegated access** to protected resources by issuing **access tokens** instead of sharing passwords.


**2. Why Do We Use OAuth?**
Without OAuth, apps would have to **store user credentials** and send them with each request. This is insecure and **violates security best practices.** OAuth provides a **safer way** to access APIs by allowing apps to get permissions from users without needing their passwords.

  

💡 **Example:**

• Imagine you want to use **“Login with Google”** to sign into an app.
• Instead of sharing your **Google password** with the app, OAuth allows the app to **request permission** to access your Google account.
• If you approve, the app gets a **temporary access token** that allows it to act on your behalf.

  

✅ **OAuth ensures:**
• **User credentials are never shared with third-party apps.**
• **Access is controlled** (only specific permissions are granted).
• **Tokens can expire** and be revoked (adding security).

**How Does OAuth Provide Security?**
OAuth 2.0 provides security through **tokens, scopes, and flows** that ensure access is granted safely. Let’s break it down:

  

**1. Access Token (Replaces Passwords)**

Instead of sending passwords, OAuth uses **Access Tokens** to authenticate API requests.
🔹 The token is a **temporary key** that authorizes an app to access resources.
🔹 Apps store and use this token for authentication instead of asking for credentials repeatedly.

  
📌 **Example:**
• When you use **“Login with Facebook”**, the app gets an **Access Token** instead of your Facebook password.
• This **Access Token** is used in API calls like **getting your profile info or posts**.

  
**🛡 Security Benefit:** Even if an access token is leaked, it’s temporary and has **limited permissions** (scopes).

**2. Scopes (Limit Access & Permissions)**
OAuth **limits what an application can access** by using **scopes**.
Scopes define **what data or actions** an app is allowed to perform.


📌 **Example:**
A fitness app wants to connect to your Google account:

• **Scope: email** → Can read your email address.
• **Scope: calendar.read** → Can read your calendar events.
• **Scope: calendar.write** → Can create events on your behalf.

🔴 The app **can’t access anything outside its scopes** (it can’t read your Google Drive files if you didn’t allow it).


**🛡 Security Benefit:** Users can **control permissions**, and apps can’t misuse access beyond what’s granted.

**3. Refresh Tokens (Keep Sessions Secure)**

Access tokens **expire** for security reasons.

To avoid making users log in again, OAuth provides **Refresh Tokens** that allow apps to get a **new Access Token** without requiring credentials.


📌 **Example:**
• Your banking app gets an **Access Token** that lasts 1 hour.
• After 1 hour, instead of asking you to log in again, the app sends a **Refresh Token** to get a new Access Token.

  

**🛡 Security Benefit:**
• If a token is compromised, it **expires quickly** (reducing risk).
• The app doesn’t need to store passwords, just the **Refresh Token**.

**4. Redirect URIs (Prevent Token Theft)**
OAuth uses **redirect URIs** to ensure that authorization responses are only sent to **trusted** apps.
When a user logs in, OAuth only redirects them to **pre-registered URLs** to prevent **token hijacking.**


📌 **Example:**
If an attacker tries to redirect a login response to hacker.com, OAuth will reject it **unless the redirect URI is registered.**


**🛡 Security Benefit:** Protects users from **malicious redirect attacks** and **token theft.**

**5. PKCE (Prevents Code Interception in Mobile & SPA Apps)**
For mobile and browser-based apps (SPAs), OAuth introduces **PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)** to prevent attacks where authorization codes are stolen.


📌 **Example Attack:**
• A hacker intercepts an **Authorization Code** sent to your app.
• Without PKCE, they could use it to get an **Access Token** for themselves.


🔹 **PKCE protects against this by requiring a special “code challenge” that only the original requester knows.**

**🛡 Security Benefit:** OAuth ensures that only the **rightful app** can exchange the authorization code for an Access Token.



**How OAuth 2.0 Works (Step-by-Step)**
OAuth has multiple **authorization flows**, but let’s see how a **user logs in with OAuth** using **Authorization Code Flow** (most secure method for web apps).

  

**Step 1: User Requests Authorization**

• A user clicks **“Login with Google”** on an app.

• The app **redirects** them to the **Google Authorization Server**.

• The user logs in and grants permission.

  

**Step 2: Google Sends Authorization Code**

• Google redirects the user **back to the app** with an **Authorization Code**.

  

**Step 3: App Exchanges Code for Access Token**

• The app sends the **Authorization Code** + **Client Credentials** to Google.

• Google verifies the request and issues an **Access Token** (and a **Refresh Token**).

  

**Step 4: App Uses Access Token to Access APIs**

• The app sends API requests using the **Access Token** in the Authorization header.

• The API validates the token and returns the requested data.

  

✅ **Secure because:**

• The **access token is short-lived** (expires quickly).

• The **refresh token is stored securely** on the server.

• The **client secret is never exposed** in the browser.

**OAuth vs Authentication: What’s the Difference?**

  

OAuth is often confused with **authentication**, but they are different:

|**Feature**|**OAuth 2.0 (Authorization)**|**Authentication (Login System)**|
|---|---|---|
|**Purpose**|Grants permission to access resources|Verifies a user’s identity|
|**Example**|“Allow this app to access your Google Drive?”|“Enter username & password to log in”|
|**Token Type**|Access Token|Session Token or ID Token|
|**Used By**|APIs, third-party apps|Login pages, identity providers|

💡 OAuth is about **authorization** (granting access), while authentication is about **verifying identity**.

**Conclusion: Why OAuth 2.0 is Important**

• ✅ Eliminates the need to share passwords with third-party apps.

• ✅ Uses **tokens** to manage access securely.

• ✅ Supports **fine-grained access control** with **scopes**.

• ✅ Protects against **token theft** with **redirect URIs & PKCE**.

• ✅ Works across **mobile, web, and API-based applications**.
