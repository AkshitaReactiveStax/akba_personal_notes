where is the docker images getting pulled from where is the repo sitting ?

psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgresUser    -d employee_db        command meaning 
outside and inside ports conflicts / how can a same port serve more than one container LXC zones concept . 
docker exec -it postgres-container bash 
why this command does not ask for password where as if we run  psql commands it ask for password whats the difference ?

image creation optimization :
BOOT-INF folder is the app -root (classpath), which contains the dependencies for the app and all stuff . 

mvn clean package 
(to update the jar file )

/classes/app is where the code is and in the jar this changes mostly.  while image creation , if only one layer is changing and the other layers are same it takes lesser time to rebuild the image from the base file .
