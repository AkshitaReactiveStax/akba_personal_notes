### What You Need to Know About Multithreading in Java:

**Multithreading** is the concept of executing multiple threads simultaneously, allowing a program to perform multiple tasks concurrently. In Java, multithreading is mainly used to improve performance, especially in CPU-bound or I/O-bound applications.

Here’s a breakdown of the key concepts you should be familiar with for your interview:

---

#### 1. **Basic Concepts:**
   - **Thread:** A thread is a lightweight process, the smallest unit of a CPU's execution.
   - **Process vs Thread:** A process has its own memory space, while threads share the same memory space of the process they belong to.
   - **Concurrency vs Parallelism:**
     - **Concurrency:** The ability of a system to handle multiple tasks at once, but not necessarily executing them simultaneously.
     - **Parallelism:** Performing multiple tasks at the same time using multiple processors or cores.
   - **Creating a Thread:**
     - Using `Thread` class: By extending `Thread` or implementing `Runnable` interface.
     - Example of using `Thread`:
       ```java
       public class MyThread extends Thread {
           public void run() {
               System.out.println("Running in a thread");
           }
       }
       MyThread t = new MyThread();
       t.start();
       ```

#### 2. **Thread Lifecycle:**
   - **New:** A thread is in the new state when it is created but not yet started.
   - **Runnable:** A thread moves to this state when `start()` is called.
   - **Blocked:** A thread moves to this state when it is waiting to acquire a lock.
   - **Waiting/Timed Waiting:** A thread is in this state when it is waiting for another thread to perform a specific action.
   - **Terminated:** A thread enters this state when its `run()` method completes.

#### 3. **Synchronization:**
   - **Problem:** Multiple threads accessing shared resources may cause inconsistent data.
   - **Solution:** Use synchronization to ensure that only one thread can access the shared resource at a time.
     - `synchronized` keyword in Java ensures mutual exclusion.
     - Example:
       ```java
       synchronized void syncMethod() {
           // Code that needs to be synchronized
       }
       ```

#### 4. **Thread Communication:**
   - **wait(), notify(), notifyAll():** These methods allow threads to communicate with each other while they are running. For instance, a thread may `wait()` until another thread calls `notify()` or `notifyAll()`.
     - `wait()` releases the lock and puts the thread into a waiting state.
     - `notify()` wakes up one thread that is waiting on the lock.
     - `notifyAll()` wakes up all threads that are waiting.

#### 5. **Executor Framework:**
   - `ExecutorService` provides a higher-level replacement for managing threads compared to directly using `Thread` class. It provides thread pools to manage a group of threads more efficiently.
     - Common implementations: `ThreadPoolExecutor`, `ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor`.
     - Example:
       ```java
       ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);
       executor.submit(() -> System.out.println("Task executed"));
       executor.shutdown();
       ```

#### 6. **Deadlock, Starvation, and Race Conditions:**
   - **Deadlock:** A condition where two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other to release resources.
   - **Starvation:** A thread is perpetually denied access to resources.
   - **Race Conditions:** Occur when two threads access shared data simultaneously, leading to unpredictable results.

- **Atomic Operations**: Using `AtomicInteger`, `AtomicLong`, and other atomic classes for thread-safe operations.
- **Parallel Streams**: How to use Java Streams in parallel for performance improvements.

---

### **==Understanding the Java Memory Model (JMM)==**

The **Java Memory Model (JMM)** is a specification that defines how threads interact through memory and what behaviors are allowed in concurrent programs. It describes how the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) handles variables, data synchronization, visibility, and ordering, which is critical for writing correct multithreaded programs.

The JMM primarily focuses on:
1. **Visibility**: Ensuring that changes made by one thread to shared variables are visible to other threads.
2. **Ordering**: Ensuring that the sequence of instructions executed by one thread is consistent with the program’s order.
3. **Atomicity**: Ensuring that certain operations appear indivisible, even when executed in multiple threads.

---

### Key Concepts in JMM:

#### 1. **Main Memory and Working Memory:**
   - **Main Memory** refers to the system’s shared memory (RAM) where all variables are stored.
   - **Working Memory** refers to the local memory of each thread, where cached copies of variables are kept.
   - Threads read and write variables from their **working memory**, and they synchronize with **main memory** via synchronization mechanisms.

#### 2. **Visibility of Shared Variables:**
   - The visibility problem arises when one thread modifies a variable in its local memory (working memory), and other threads might not see that change.
   - **Happens-Before Relationship**: The JMM defines a "happens-before" relationship to guarantee that changes made by one thread are visible to other threads. If one action "happens-before" another, the result of the first is visible to the second.
   - The primary mechanisms to ensure visibility include:
     - **`volatile` keyword**: Ensures that writes to a variable are immediately visible to other threads.
     - **`synchronized` blocks**: Establishes happens-before relationships when a thread enters or exits a synchronized block.
     - **`final` keyword**: Ensures that the constructor of an object is visible to all threads after its creation.

#### 3. **Ordering of Instructions:**
   - The JMM allows certain optimizations (like instruction reordering) to improve performance. However, this reordering can lead to inconsistent behavior in multithreaded environments.
   - **JMM guarantees**:
     - The **program order** is preserved within a single thread.
     - For multi-threaded execution, the JVM and CPU must respect the happens-before relationship.

#### 4. **Atomicity:**
   - Atomic operations are indivisible. For example, reading or writing a single variable is an atomic operation, but composite operations (like incrementing a variable) might not be atomic.
   - For atomic operations, you can use the `synchronized` keyword or `java.util.concurrent.atomic` classes (e.g., `AtomicInteger`).

#### 5. **Final Fields:**
   - A `final` field in Java guarantees that once a field is assigned, it cannot be changed. The JMM ensures that the final field’s value is visible to all threads after the constructor of an object is completed.

#### 6. **The Happens-Before Relationship:**
   The JMM defines specific rules to determine when one operation happens-before another. This relationship is crucial to ensuring that memory changes made by one thread are visible to others.

   Some important **happens-before rules**:
   - A write to a `volatile` variable happens-before any subsequent read of that variable.
   - The release of a lock on a synchronized block happens-before any subsequent acquire of that lock.
   - A thread’s `start()` method happens-before the thread’s `run()` method.

#### 7. **Thread Interference and Race Conditions:**
   - **Thread interference** occurs when multiple threads access shared data without synchronization, leading to inconsistent or incorrect results.
   - **Race conditions** arise when the behavior of a program depends on the non-deterministic timing of thread execution.

#### 8. **Java’s `volatile` Keyword:**
   - The `volatile` keyword ensures that a variable's value is read from and written to main memory directly, not cached in a thread’s local memory.
   - This prevents **caching** of values and guarantees visibility of changes to all threads.

#### 9. **Locking Mechanisms:**
   - **`synchronized` blocks** and **explicit locks (like `ReentrantLock`)** in Java enforce mutual exclusion and visibility guarantees.
   - They can also create a happens-before relationship between threads.

### Conclusion:
The **Java Memory Model (JMM)** is essential to understanding how threads interact with memory in a multithreaded Java application. A solid grasp of the JMM will help ensure that your concurrent programs are thread-safe, efficient, and free of bugs like race conditions and visibility issues. 

If you'd like to dive deeper into any of these areas or need further clarification on a specific concept, feel free to ask!







### **==Locks and Synchronization Techniques in Java==**

When working with multiple threads in Java, **synchronization** and **locking** are key concepts to ensure **thread safety**, **data consistency**, and to prevent issues like **race conditions**, **deadlock**, and **data corruption**.

#### 1. **Synchronization in Java**
Synchronization in Java is a mechanism that ensures that only one thread can access a resource at a time. It prevents thread interference and ensures **visibility** of shared data across threads.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Mutual Exclusion (Mutex):** Ensures that only one thread can execute a block of code at a time.
- **Visibility:** Ensures that changes made by one thread to shared data are visible to other threads.
- **Happens-Before Relationship:** Synchronization creates a happens-before relationship between threads.

#### 2. **Synchronized Methods and Blocks**
In Java, you can make methods or blocks of code synchronized to ensure thread safety.

- **Synchronized Method:**
  ```java
  public synchronized void increment() {
      count++;
  }
  ```

  The `synchronized` keyword ensures that only one thread can execute the method at a time for the same object.

- **Synchronized Block:**
  ```java
  public void increment() {
      synchronized(this) {
          count++;
      }
  }
  ```

  A synchronized block is used to lock a specific section of code rather than the entire method. This provides better granularity and can improve performance by reducing the scope of synchronization.

#### 3. **Locks in Java**
While the `synchronized` keyword provides a simple way to ensure mutual exclusion, it can be limiting in terms of flexibility. To address this, Java provides more advanced synchronization mechanisms via **explicit locks**.

- **ReentrantLock (java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock):**
  The `ReentrantLock` class allows more advanced locking operations than the `synchronized` keyword. It allows for features like **try-lock**, **timed-lock**, and **interruptible lock acquisition**.

  **Example:**
  ```java
  Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
  
  public void increment() {
      lock.lock();
      try {
          count++;
      } finally {
          lock.unlock();
      }
  }
  ```

  - `lock.lock()` acquires the lock.
  - `lock.unlock()` releases the lock.
  - The `finally` block ensures the lock is released even if an exception occurs.

- **ReadWriteLock (java.util.concurrent.locks.ReadWriteLock):**
  This lock allows multiple threads to read a shared resource concurrently, while ensuring exclusive access when a thread writes to it.

  **Example:**
  ```java
  ReadWriteLock lock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
  Lock readLock = lock.readLock();
  Lock writeLock = lock.writeLock();
  
  public void read() {
      readLock.lock();
      try {
          // read shared resource
      } finally {
          readLock.unlock();
      }
  }
  
  public void write() {
      writeLock.lock();
      try {
          // modify shared resource
      } finally {
          writeLock.unlock();
      }
  }
  ```

  - **Read Lock:** Multiple threads can acquire a read lock simultaneously if no thread holds a write lock.
  - **Write Lock:** Only one thread can hold the write lock, and no other threads can acquire the read or write lock.

#### 4. **Atomic Variables**
To avoid the overhead of locking, Java provides atomic classes in the `java.util.concurrent.atomic` package (e.g., `AtomicInteger`, `AtomicLong`). These classes perform thread-safe operations without the need for synchronization.

- **Example:**
  ```java
  AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);

  public void increment() {
      count.incrementAndGet();
  }
  ```

  These classes perform atomic operations like **increment**, **decrement**, **add**, etc., in a thread-safe manner.

#### 5. **Deadlock**
Deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other to release resources. To avoid deadlock:
- Ensure that all threads acquire locks in the same order.
- Use timeouts when acquiring locks.
- Use higher-level abstractions like `ReentrantLock`, which can detect deadlocks.

#### 6. **Semaphore**
A **Semaphore** is a synchronization primitive that controls access to a resource pool. It allows a fixed number of threads to access a resource concurrently.

**Example:**
```java
Semaphore semaphore = new Semaphore(3); // Allow 3 threads to access the resource.

public void accessResource() {
    try {
        semaphore.acquire();
        // Access shared resource
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
    } finally {
        semaphore.release();
    }
}
```

- **acquire():** Decreases the semaphore count. If the count is zero, the thread blocks until it can acquire a permit.
- **release():** Increases the semaphore count, allowing other threads to acquire permits.

### **==Understanding ThreadLocal Storage in Java==**

**ThreadLocal** is a mechanism in Java that provides thread-local variables, meaning each thread accessing a `ThreadLocal` variable will have its own independent copy. This is especially useful in situations where you want each thread to have its own instance of a variable, avoiding synchronization issues while still maintaining thread safety.

---

### Key Concepts of **ThreadLocal Storage**:

#### 1. **What is `ThreadLocal`?**
- `ThreadLocal` is a class in the `java.lang` package that provides a thread-local copy of a variable.
- A `ThreadLocal` variable is **unique to each thread**, meaning each thread accessing the variable will have its own isolated copy, which prevents interference between threads.
- It helps in managing variables that should not be shared among threads, like database connections, user sessions, etc.

#### 2. **How does `ThreadLocal` Work?**
- Each thread that accesses a `ThreadLocal` variable has its own private copy. Threads cannot see each other's values for the `ThreadLocal` variable.
- The value of a `ThreadLocal` variable is **not shared** among threads, and it is automatically initialized when accessed for the first time in the thread.
  
**Example:**
```java
public class ThreadLocalExample {
    private static ThreadLocal<Integer> threadLocalValue = ThreadLocal.withInitial(() -> 0); // Initial value is 0

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Runnable task1 = () -> {
            threadLocalValue.set(10);
            System.out.println("Thread 1: " + threadLocalValue.get());
        };

        Runnable task2 = () -> {
            threadLocalValue.set(20);
            System.out.println("Thread 2: " + threadLocalValue.get());
        };

        Thread thread1 = new Thread(task1);
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(task2);

        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }
}
```

In this example, each thread gets its own value for `threadLocalValue`, so the output will be:
```
Thread 1: 10
Thread 2: 20
```

#### 3. **Key Methods in `ThreadLocal`:**
- **`ThreadLocal.withInitial(Supplier<? extends T> supplier)`**: This method is used to initialize the thread-local variable. It takes a `Supplier` that provides the initial value for the thread-local variable.
- **`get()`**: Returns the value for the current thread. If no value has been set for the current thread, it initializes the value using the initial value defined.
- **`set(T value)`**: Sets a value for the current thread's local variable.
- **`remove()`**: Removes the value for the current thread. This method helps in cleaning up the thread-local variable when it's no longer needed.

#### 4. **Why Use `ThreadLocal`?**
- **Avoids Synchronization Overhead:** Since each thread has its own copy of the variable, no synchronization is required to ensure thread safety for the variable.
- **Thread Safety:** It prevents race conditions and ensures thread-local isolation.
- **Improved Performance:** Reduces the need for expensive synchronization and locking mechanisms when threads do not need to share state.

#### 5. **Typical Use Cases for `ThreadLocal`:**
- **Database Connections:** Each thread may need its own connection to a database.
- **User Sessions:** In web applications, each thread handling a request may need its own session or authentication context.
- **Formatters and Parsers:** Each thread can have its own formatter/parse instance, which might not be thread-safe, without needing synchronization.

---

### Things to Keep in Mind:
- **Memory Leaks:** If you use `ThreadLocal` variables, you must be careful to call `remove()` to avoid memory leaks. This is because thread-local variables are not garbage collected until the thread terminates, and if the thread local variable is not cleaned up, it can cause memory leaks, especially in long-running applications with many threads.
  
  Example of cleanup:
  ```java
  threadLocalValue.remove();
  ```

- **Non-shared Data:** Since `ThreadLocal` variables are not shared between threads, they are not suitable for scenarios where data must be shared among multiple threads.

- **Initialization:** A `ThreadLocal` variable is initialized for each thread. So if a thread tries to access the variable before setting it, it will get the **default initial value** (as defined by the `ThreadLocal.withInitial()` method).

- **ThreadLocal does not make sense in situations where you have a small number of threads** sharing data that needs synchronization. In such cases, using normal synchronization mechanisms (e.g., `synchronized` blocks or `ReentrantLock`) is often more appropriate.

6. **Can a `ThreadLocal` variable be garbage collected? If not, why?**
7. **Explain how `ThreadLocal` differs from other concurrency utilities in Java like `synchronized` blocks or `ReentrantLock`.**
8. **What are the limitations of using `ThreadLocal` for thread safety?**
9. **How does the `ThreadLocal` class handle thread-specific initialization of variables?**
10. **What happens when you call `ThreadLocal.remove()`?**

#### **Advanced Questions:**
1. **In a web application, what is the use of `ThreadLocal` in handling user sessions or request contexts?**
2. **How would you handle a situation where a `ThreadLocal` variable has been initialized but needs to be reset or modified based on certain conditions?**
3. **What are the consequences of not calling `remove()` on a `ThreadLocal` variable in a long-running thread pool?**
4. **How does the JVM manage the lifecycle of `ThreadLocal` variables in terms of memory management and thread termination?**
5. **Can `ThreadLocal` be used in multithreaded frameworks like ExecutorService or ForkJoinPool? How would you manage thread-local data in those cases?**

7. **Can `ThreadLocal` be used in conjunction with other concurrency utilities like `AtomicInteger` or `ReentrantLock`? Provide an example.**
8. **How would you handle complex scenarios where a `ThreadLocal` variable's value needs to be consistent across multiple threads but not shared directly between them?**
9. **What is the effect of calling `ThreadLocal.get()` in a thread where the `ThreadLocal` variable has not been set explicitly?**
10. **How does `ThreadLocal` handle situations where a thread pool (ExecutorService) is reused by multiple threads, and how does it ensure thread-local data is isolated?**

---

### Conclusion:

**ThreadLocal** is a powerful tool in Java for isolating variables between threads, improving performance by eliminating the need for synchronization, and ensuring thread safety for independent data. It is most useful when you want to keep data isolated within the scope of each thread but do not want to deal with the complexity or performance overhead of synchronization.






### **==Understanding Atomic Operations in Java==**

**Atomic operations** refer to operations that are performed as a single, indivisible unit. In other words, an atomic operation either completes entirely or does not start at all, without any intermediate states being visible to other threads. This concept is crucial in concurrent programming, especially when multiple threads are accessing and modifying shared resources.

In Java, atomic operations are typically associated with **thread-safe** manipulations of shared variables. Without atomicity, operations like reading, modifying, and writing shared variables can lead to inconsistencies or **race conditions**, where the results depend on the unpredictable order of thread execution.

### Key Concepts of **Atomic Operations**:

#### 1. **What Makes an Operation Atomic?**
- **Indivisibility**: Atomic operations happen in one uninterrupted step. For example, a read-modify-write sequence on a shared variable should be executed as one indivisible operation.
- **No Interruption**: The operation is not interrupted by other threads, ensuring consistency during its execution.
  
#### 2. **Atomicity in Concurrency**
In multi-threaded applications, atomic operations prevent the situation where one thread reads a value from memory, another thread writes to the same memory location, and the first thread writes its value back, creating inconsistencies.

Consider the example of incrementing a shared counter:
```java
counter = counter + 1; // Not atomic
```
In this case, the operation involves multiple steps:
1. Read `counter`.
2. Add 1 to it.
3. Write the result back to `counter`.

If multiple threads perform this operation concurrently, they might read the same value, add 1, and write it back, causing a race condition. This is where **atomic operations** come in to prevent such inconsistencies.

#### 3. **Atomic Variables in Java**
In Java, atomic operations are provided through the `java.util.concurrent.atomic` package. This package provides a set of classes for performing atomic operations on variables, such as `AtomicInteger`, `AtomicLong`, `AtomicBoolean`, and `AtomicReference`.

- **`AtomicInteger`**: This class provides atomic methods like `incrementAndGet()`, `decrementAndGet()`, `getAndAdd()`, etc., which ensure that modifications to integers are performed atomically.

  **Example:**
  ```java
  AtomicInteger counter = new AtomicInteger(0);

  // Atomically increment the value
  counter.incrementAndGet(); // Counter is now 1

  // Atomically add a value and get the result
  int result = counter.addAndGet(5); // Counter is now 6
  ```

#### 4. **Why Use Atomic Variables?**
Atomic operations ensure that only one thread at a time modifies the variable, thereby preventing race conditions and ensuring consistency across multiple threads. These classes provide a lock-free mechanism to achieve atomicity and performance.

Key benefits of atomic variables:
- **Thread-Safety**: Atomic variables ensure safe concurrent access without the need for locks, which improves performance.
- **Lock-Free Operations**: The `Atomic` classes in Java perform atomic operations without the overhead of acquiring a lock, making them highly efficient.
  
#### 5. **How Atomic Operations Work Internally**
Internally, atomic operations are often implemented using **Compare-And-Swap (CAS)**, a low-level atomic instruction provided by most modern processors. The CAS mechanism works as follows:
- The operation checks if the value of the variable matches an expected value (read-modify-write).
- If the value hasn't changed, the new value is written to the variable.
- If the value has changed (indicating another thread modified it), the operation fails and is retried.

This ensures that the update is done atomically and without interference from other threads.

#### 6. **Atomic Operations vs. Synchronized Blocks**
- **Atomic operations**: These are performed without acquiring locks and are typically more efficient. For example, using `AtomicInteger.incrementAndGet()` performs the increment operation atomically, and no synchronization is needed.
- **Synchronized blocks**: Synchronized blocks are used to ensure that only one thread at a time can access a critical section of code, but they introduce locking overhead. Atomic operations are generally preferred for simple atomic tasks (like incrementing a counter) because they avoid the performance cost associated with locking.

### Common Classes in the `java.util.concurrent.atomic` Package:

1. **AtomicInteger**: For performing atomic operations on integers.
   - Methods: `incrementAndGet()`, `decrementAndGet()`, `compareAndSet()`, `addAndGet()`.
   
2. **AtomicLong**: Similar to `AtomicInteger`, but for long values.
   
3. **AtomicBoolean**: A boolean type that supports atomic operations.
   
4. **AtomicReference**: Supports atomic operations for object references.
   
5. **AtomicMarkableReference**: This class allows for atomic updates of references along with a boolean value (mark).

6. **AtomicStampedReference**: Similar to `AtomicMarkableReference`, but it maintains a versioned timestamp (stamp) for the reference.

### **==Understanding Parallel Streams in Java==**

**Parallel Streams** in Java are part of the Java 8 Stream API and provide a way to perform operations on data in parallel across multiple threads. This can lead to performance improvements, especially with large datasets, by utilizing multiple cores of the processor.

Before diving into **parallel streams**, let's first understand **streams** and the concept of **parallelism** in Java.

---

### Key Concepts  

#### 1. **What is a Stream in Java?**
A **stream** in Java is a sequence of data that can be processed in a functional style. Streams allow for operations like filtering, mapping, reducing, and collecting, without requiring explicit iteration.

Example of a simple stream:
```java
List<String> list = Arrays.asList("a", "b", "c", "d");

list.stream()
    .filter(s -> s.equals("a"))
    .forEach(System.out::println);
```

This code filters out the string `"a"` from the list and prints it. This is a **sequential stream**, meaning that the operations are performed one after the other, in the order the data appears in the list.

#### 2. **What is a Parallel Stream?**
A **parallel stream** is a type of stream that can process elements concurrently using multiple threads. The Java Stream API allows you to easily convert a sequential stream into a parallel one by calling the `parallel()` method.

Example:
```java
List<String> list = Arrays.asList("a", "b", "c", "d");

list.parallelStream()
    .filter(s -> s.equals("a"))
    .forEach(System.out::println);
```

- **Sequential Stream**: The operations are performed one after the other on each element.
- **Parallel Stream**: The operations can be performed concurrently on multiple elements, taking advantage of multi-core processors.

#### 3. **How Parallel Streams Work?**
When you create a **parallel stream** in Java, it internally splits the data into chunks and processes those chunks concurrently using a **ForkJoinPool** (a thread pool designed for parallel execution). The tasks are divided and then the results are combined to give the final result.

Key points about parallel streams:
- The stream divides the dataset into smaller chunks, which are processed independently in parallel.
- The results from these smaller chunks are combined to produce the final result.
- By default, Java uses a **ForkJoinPool** with a number of threads equal to the number of available processors on the machine.

#### 4. **Benefits of Parallel Streams**
- **Performance**: For large datasets, parallel streams can offer significant performance improvements by utilizing multiple CPU cores.
- **Simplicity**: Parallel streams allow you to write parallel code in a declarative and functional style, without having to manage low-level concurrency constructs like threads and executors.
  
#### 5. **How to Use Parallel Streams**
To create a parallel stream, you can either:
- Use the `.parallelStream()` method:
  ```java
  List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
  numbers.parallelStream().forEach(System.out::println);
  ```

- Convert a sequential stream to a parallel stream using the `.parallel()` method:
  ```java
  List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
  numbers.stream().parallel().forEach(System.out::println);
  ```

#### 6. **How Parallel Streams Work Internally**
Parallel streams are implemented using the **ForkJoinPool**, which splits the stream into multiple substreams and processes them in parallel. The results from each substream are then combined in a manner defined by the specific operation being performed.

**Key Process Flow**:
1. The stream is split into multiple parts.
2. Each part is processed independently by a thread in the ForkJoinPool.
3. The results are merged back together.

#### 7. **When to Use Parallel Streams**
Parallel streams are most beneficial when:
- You are dealing with large datasets.
- The operation performed on each element of the stream is **CPU-bound** (e.g., mathematical computations, sorting).
- The tasks can be executed independently (without shared state or dependencies between tasks).

However, parallel streams can introduce overhead when:
- The dataset is small (the cost of splitting and merging is higher than the benefit of parallelism).
- The operation involves side effects or shared mutable state.
- The tasks are **I/O-bound** (e.g., database queries, file reading/writing), where parallelism may not improve performance.

---

### Parallel Streams in Detail: Key Operations

1. **`forEach()`**: Prints elements of the stream in parallel, where each element might be processed by different threads.
2. **`map()`**: Transforms elements in parallel (e.g., squaring each element).
3. **`reduce()`**: Combines the results of parallel operations, which can be tricky if the combining operation is not associative (e.g., addition is associative, but string concatenation is not).
4. **`collect()`**: Collects the results from parallel streams into a container (e.g., list, set).

Absolutely! Here are **3 high-quality interview-level multithreaded coding problems** beyond the basic producer-consumer — commonly asked at companies like Amazon, Bloomberg, and fintech startups.

---

## ✅ 1. **Bounded Buffer (Producer-Consumer with Multiple Threads)**

**🧩 Problem:**  
Implement a **bounded buffer** that allows:

- Multiple producers and consumers
    
- Uses low-level synchronization: `wait()`/`notifyAll()`
    
- Supports `put(item)` and `get()` methods
    

**🔧 Bonus Twist:** Track how many items each thread produced or consumed for auditing.

**Interview Focus:** Thread coordination, fairness, deadlock avoidance.

---

## ✅ 2. **Thread-safe Stack**

**🧩 Problem:**  
Build a **thread-safe stack** using `LinkedList` or `ArrayList`.

Implement:

- `push(E item)`
    
- `pop()` – blocks if empty until an item is pushed
    
- `size()`
    

```java
class BlockingStack<E> {
    public void push(E item);
    public E pop(); // blocks if empty
}
```

**Challenge Points:**

- Avoid race conditions
    
- Ensure thread waiting if empty
    
- Proper use of `while (empty)` with `wait()`/`notify()`
    

**Bonus:** Add timeout to `pop(int timeoutMillis)` using `wait(timeout)`.

---

## ✅ 3. **Rate Limiter (Token Bucket)**

**🧩 Problem:**  
Implement a **RateLimiter** class to allow up to `N` requests per second.

```java
class RateLimiter {
    boolean allowRequest(); // returns true if request allowed, else false
}
```

**Example:**

- Limit: 5 requests/sec → allow 5 requests, then block further until time window resets
    

**🔧 Advanced Versions:**

- Use `wait()`/`notify()` to block requests if rate exceeded
    
- Implement **leaky bucket** or **sliding window** logic
    
- Make it **fair** across multiple threads
    

**Interview Angle:**

- System design concepts in microservices
    
- Time-based token refill logic
    
- Thread coordination and clock correctness
    

---

## ✅ 4. **Thread-safe Logger with Buffer Flush**

**🧩 Problem:**  
Design a logger that:

- Buffers log messages in memory
    
- Flushes to disk (or console) every `N` seconds or when the buffer hits size `K`
    
- Is thread-safe (multiple threads log in parallel)
    

```java
class BufferedLogger {
    void log(String message); // non-blocking
}
```

**Internals:**

- One background thread checks buffer every `N` seconds
    
- Flushes log safely and resets buffer
    

**Goal:** You’re simulating log batching in real-world systems (e.g., Kafka Connect, Splunk forwarders)

---

## ✅ 5. **Blocking Bounded Priority Queue**

**🧩 Problem:**  
Build a **blocking priority queue** with fixed size. Higher priority elements come out first.

```java
class BlockingPriorityQueue<E> {
    void put(E item, int priority); // blocks if full
    E take();                       // blocks if empty
}
```

**Design Tips:**

- Use a custom comparator
    
- Combine with `wait()`/`notifyAll()` for blocking
    
- Backed by a `PriorityQueue` with synchronized access
    

---

- `wait()` / `notify()`
    
- Thread-safe producer-consumer logic
    
- Proper usage of `synchronized` and shared resources
    
- Robust loop-based condition checks
    

---

---

## 🧠 Requirements:

- **Bounded** → Has a fixed size
    
- `put(E e)` → Adds element to queue; **waits** if full
    
- `take()` → Removes element from queue; **waits** if empty
    

---

## ✅ Full Code Implementation:

```java
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

public class BlockingQueueCustom<E> {
    private final Queue<E> queue = new LinkedList<>();
    private final int capacity;

    public BlockingQueueCustom(int capacity) {
        this.capacity = capacity;
    }

    public void put(E item) throws InterruptedException {
        synchronized (queue) {
            while (queue.size() == capacity) {
                System.out.println("Queue is full. Producer waiting...");
                queue.wait(); // Wait until space is available
            }

            queue.add(item);
            System.out.println("Produced: " + item);
            queue.notifyAll(); // Notify any waiting consumers
        }
    }

    public E take() throws InterruptedException {
        synchronized (queue) {
            while (queue.isEmpty()) {
                System.out.println("Queue is empty. Consumer waiting...");
                queue.wait(); // Wait until item is available
            }

            E item = queue.poll();
            System.out.println("Consumed: " + item);
            queue.notifyAll(); // Notify any waiting producers
            return item;
        }
    }
}
```

            for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                try {
                    queue.put(i);
                    Thread.sleep(100); // Simulate work
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                }
            }
        };

        // Consumer
        Runnable consumer = () -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                try {
                    queue.take();
                    Thread.sleep(150); // Simulate work
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                }
            }
        };
